We often think of resilience as a reaction to external pressures. That is, we define resilience as our ability to bounce back from difficulties and challenges, frequently as some version of “still here... in spite of something else.” Chinatown is still here, in spite of racialized policies. Indigenous communities and cultures are still here, and have always been here, in spite of the individual and systemic violences that have attempted to eradicate them for centuries. We are still here, in spite of the harm and grief COVID-19 has caused our communities.

While it’s more important than ever to celebrate still being here, what’s often missed in this particular narrative of resilience is who and what are no longer here. Furthermore, this way of thinking simply accepts the existence of these external pressures and oppressive forces without questioning or reflecting upon why they have to exist in the first place.

In this issue of Chinatown Stories, we aim to reimagine resilience. We hope to invoke ongoing conversations about what resilience can look like, not simply as reactions to adversity, but rather as acts of subversion and resistance. For instance, what does resilience look like as community building? How can food security be reconceptualized as a form of resilience, and how has resilience changed our relationship to food? How can we rethink art as resilience, and unpack its complicated relationship to gentrification?

This publication explores how the resilience of Chinatown comes from its intangible heritage, and conversely, how resilience becomes the intangible heritage and cultural asset that allows Chinatown to thrive in the face of precarity caused by systemic oppressive forces.

The interviews and multimedia artwork in this issue highlight both what resilience means to Chinatown communities as well as why these communities are worth fighting for. We invite you to bear witness to these stories and to reflect on ways that you are still here, as a result of which we are still here.
