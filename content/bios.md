#### Alyssa Sy de Jesus

Alyssa Sy de Jesus (施麗莎) is a migrant twice moved from China and currently settles on the unceded lands of the Squamish, Tsleil-Waututh, and Musqueam peoples. As an academic, she studies the legacies of long eighteenth-century empire, orientalism and gendered material cultures. As a museum curator, she is interested in stories of migration that challenge the model minority narrative. As a creative writer, she looks into these same topics as they sometimes expand into our experiences of ancestors and ghosts.
