**CT:** What do you think of when you think of Chinatown?

**A:** So many things come to mind, from the Jack Nicholson movie to just the idea of space for Chinese people. I think about growing up in the various Chinatowns in Toronto, places where we used to get Chinese baked goods and groceries. Even from a very young age, there was a sense of belonging, but exoticism as well.

**CT:** Do you notice many parallels between Chinatowns in different cities?

**A:** Of course. In larger cities like Toronto, New York, and San Francisco, there are similarities in colour scheme and types of shops. The apothecaries come to mind very quickly, as do the barbeque and baked goods shops. It’s a lot of the Cantonese and Hakka diaspora in North America. My interaction with Chinatown in Toronto was different. The main difference is proximity to Downtown Eastside of the Vancouver Chinatown versus the Chinatowns in Toronto. It’s a more challenging place to live, to experience, and to be around. That is a main difference that always colours my perception of Chinatown.

**CT:** Why is Vancouver’s Chinatown important to you?

**A:** Chinatown is home to me in its own sense. I’ve spent the last nine years here, almost everyday. I’m now part business owner, I work here everyday, and I support businesses here. It’s a place of refuge for my culture, because it’s a repository for our food, our language, and
our ethnicity. It’s a place of belonging. **CT:** What’s your fondest memory in Chinatown?

**A:** My fondest memory would be the opening of Kissa Tanto. I’ve been working in restaurants for almost 20 years now, and it’s always been a dream of mine to be a restaurateur. When the opportunity presented itself, it was a lifelong dream come true. Everything in that first year of when Kissa Tanto first opened was a happy memory for me.

**CT:** What does resilience mean to you?

**A:** It means putting in continuous effort in the face of adversity. Chinatowns around the world are all examples of resilience, especially this year. The fact that we’re all still here, not throwing in the towel and moving to another neighbourhood, means we believe in this neighbourhood, and believe in the people of this neighbourhood. I think that’s a good example of resilience. It’s been a difficult year for everyone, but working and being involved in this neighbourhood makes it feel like there’s been more adversity here than in others.

## Resilience is not necessarily being rough, or macho, or strong, and it doesn’t mean being unbreakable. It’s being able to do something even when it’s not easy.

**CT:** Marginalized communities, especially in the Downtown Eastside, tend to fall through the cracks, especially in these hard times. Since you work in the neighbourhood, what are some of the ways you’ve seen or experienced the COVID-19 pandemic?

**A:** We shut down the restaurants before the mandate. We felt something larger was coming, and we wanted to ensure the safety of our customers and our staff. Since reopening, we’ve had to build barriers and take tables out. We’ve had to adapt to higher cleaning standards, new parameters on how staff interact with customers, how we receive orders from suppliers, and skyrocketing produce prices. The activity of the neighbourhood denizens has gone down. Chinese people have been coming less, and there has been an increase in homelessness.

**CT:** Can you say more about the increase in product prices? Do you get your products locally or do they come from abroad?

**A:** In the summer we buy mostly local. We work with six different farms throughout the lower mainland to buy the freshest vegetables we can. Our suppliers know we prioritize local vegetables over those from California or Mexico during the times when it’s available. But with COVID-19 this summer, these local farms were simply not planting and not operating to their fullest extent, if at all. The local abundance we normally have was just not there, and the local vegetables we can get have a much steeper price. The vegetables imported from California and Mexico have been much more expensive as well. There are also COVID-related supply chain issues, such as products not coming across the border as quickly as possible, or wholesalers just having a low inventory of stuff.

**CT:** What do you think are the ways this pandemic will change Chinatown?

**A:** I’m part of the Chinatown Legacy Stewardship Group, which is a team that’s been assembled by the City through the Chinatown Transformation Team to try and have a say in what Chinatown’s future will look like. It was already a difficult task before the pandemic. Now it has become even more difficult to organize virtually. We have funding from the City that we’ve divided into four working groups, and each group is trying to work on an initiative that will support Chinatown’s future. I feel that Chinatown is worth saving and is worth being a part of, but I don’t know what it will look like a couple of years from now, or even in six months. We constantly talk about how to revitalize Chinatown, and we have lots of ideas that we’re slowly working on to try and realize. COVID-19 has been what we hope to be a speedbump, but at the moment, it feels like the wall from Game of Thrones.

**CT:** What are some examples of cultural assets or intangible heritage you see in your day to day life?

**A:** People come to Chinatown for both tangible and intangible things. They come to eat, do their shopping, to preserve their language, to practice martial arts, and to learn new things. This feeling of belonging, of community, is intangible. It’s not bought, it’s not quantified, but that sense of belonging in a community is felt. Seeing people of the same background and doing the same things that you’re doing, that is an intangible positive.

**CT:** In Chinatown, there are businesses that have been here for generations,as well as relatively newer businesses like Bao Bei. What does it mean to be a newer business in Chinatown, and where do you see yourself fitting in the community?

**A:** There’s a definite incumbent versus newcomer bias, as with anything in Chinatown. Chinatown has to evolve, and I personally want a say in how it evolves. Perhaps some of the older businesses don’t see that, or are resistant to that, but it’s not about us versus them. It should be a cooperative effort. Bao Bei has been here for 10 years now, and we are part of the community. I think COVID-19 has shown us that we can always be bigger parts of the community, which is what we’ve pushed more for. I hope and want Kissa Tanto to be more involved in the community as well. It’s taken some time to build before we started remobilizing revenues towards different things, but now we are in the position where we can take care of our employees better, and we can be more active in the community. We’re looking forward to being able to do that.

**CT:** Bao Bei does a lot of things behind the scenes that a lot of people don’t know about, one of them being Chinatown Cares. Can you tell us a bit about what that is?

**A:** Chinatown Cares is an initiative started by Chinatown Today, Yarrow Intergenerational Society for Justice, and the hua foundation. In the first couple of days after lock down, the folks at hua foundation reached out to me about helping out the seniors in the community. I jumped on board because food security is important to me. I volunteer for the Greater Vancouver Food Bank, and Bao Bei supports the Chinatown Seniors Community Kitchen. Logistically there was a bunch of food at the restaurants that needed to be repurposed. The program ended up being a way of getting culturally appropriate groceries out to the seniors, plus some cooked food for those that wanted it. With my contacts with local suppliers, we could order the products from the grocery stores in Chinatown, I could cook in the kitchen, and we could use the floor space to package and distribute groceries. Bao Bei was a natural fit to be the staging area.

**CT:** Are there things you’ve learned or have been surprised about through this experience of participating in Chinatown Cares?

**A:** So much. I had not been part of a grassroots, community initiative before, and I learned a lot about funding, how much support an initiative like this can receive, and how it all happens. We raised quite a sum of money in a ridiculously short period of time during a time when I thought people would be tightening their purse strings. I’m constantly impressed by how quickly and cohesively the community can come together to get behind a project. It was also new to me to organize in this context. I met and am working with some wonderful people, and I got to know people who I’ve worked with before in a different context.

**CT:** Just having a sense of community has been so important, because COVID-19 can be so isolating. Did you have any big fears or worries during these times? How have they affected your mental health?

**A:** I definitely had some existential angst about whether this is the end of civilization as we know it. It was an exhausting March and April, being in lockdown while still trying to make sense of it all, and to take care of my family, my staff, and the restaurants. I threw myself into work, because work is what made sense, and it was at least a constant I could look forward to. Mental health was definitely a big challenge. I came down into Chinatown during lockdown everyday, and I was worried about the community here, transmission rates, as well as vandalism. But going back to the word resilience, I recently came across a zine called Eat Bitter, which is 吃苦 in Chinese. It’s something I’ve heard throughout my life, and definitely felt like I was eating a lot of bitter March through May. I think resilience is in our genetic make up. I ate a lot of bitter, and I try really hard not to regurgitate it. Sometimes I can’t help it.

**CT:** Speaking of people pulling together and organizing, have you seen much of the Black Lives Matter movement?

**A:** How it unfolded, and how quickly it unfolded took a lot of people by surprise. I cheered it on. I’ve been a keen observer of police brutality, especially against Black people. There are a lot more Black people in Toronto where I grew up compared to here in Vancouver. I didn’t see or understand how BLM would translate in Vancouver. I had to educate myself. I didn’t know what Hogan’s Alley was, even though it was literally next door. They were our neighbours. We had planned to collect a portion of Bao Bei’s food sales during weekly Sunday dinners for Chinatown Care Packages, but we ended up redirecting funds to Hogan’s Alley Society and Black Lives Matter Vancouver. I saw the blockade on the Georgia Viaduct as part of the BLM movement in support of Hogan’s Alley. Seeing one of our staff at Bao Bei experience this, and talking to her about this, was an emotional thing for me as well. We continue to support Hogan’s Alley and Black Lives Matter Vancouver, and there’s a part of me that’s glad that there’s this upheaval in the US and around the world, because it’s a chance to finally rip off the band-aids so those wounds heal better than before. People need to see this movement, hear about it, talk about it, and respond to it. Things need to change.

**CT:** Do you have any observations on policing in Chinatown?

**A:** The Vancouver Police Department (VPD)’s policing is laughable to me. I
understand that I don’t see everything from their point of view, but anecdotally, experientially, there’s really nothing the VPD can do when a crime occurs. VPD is in the neighbourhood. If uniforms were on the beat more often, would there be fewer low-level petty crimes? There might be. I don’t know. But their presence is not felt, or experienced other than when something bad has happened, or they’re all congregating at the Dalina and having coffee. I understand their jobs are difficult and they’re human beings as well, but maybe my idea of policing and the VPD is different from what it should be. I feel that the VPD are kind of powerless in Vancouver, and especially Chinatown.

**CT:** What are some ways you think the general population can support the community?

**A:** Chinatown’s continual survival and prosperity depends on the community coming here to make it happen. There needs to be people here shopping, eating at the restaurants, walking the streets, conversing, and sharing. Their presence would mitigate some of the friction between the communities. When there’s more people on the streets, there’s fewer people spray painting the walls. When there are more people at the restaurants, there are fewer people being accosted. If there are more people around, then everything is better.

**CT:** What have you been doing or making during the pandemic to take care of yourself?

**A:** I’ve been spending time with my partner and her family. She is Chinese-Venezualan, and with the recent upheaval in Venezuela, her entire family has moved here and live under one roof. I spend a lot of time with them now, which gives me happiness. They’re a hospitality family as well. They own Chinese restaurants in Venezuela, so everything is centered around food. That’s totally in my wheelhouse. We eat a lot, everybody takes turns cooking, we all sit around a giant round table with a spinning centre, just like at Chinese restaurants. It’s good to spend time with them and decompress.
