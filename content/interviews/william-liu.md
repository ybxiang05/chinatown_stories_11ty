subtitle: Kam Wai Dim Sum
order: 1
blurb: "William Liu is the owner and operator of Kam Wai Dim Sum, a dim sum speciality company located at 249 East Pender. Kam Wai has been serving the Chinatown community for almost 30 years, and is one of the last places in Chinatown where one can grab a delicious and filling hot lunch at an accessible price. The shop front is unassuming, and though the menus on the walls have been overwritten time and time again to reflect changes in available items and fluctuating prices, just one bite of their mushroom chicken rice (冬菇滑雞飯) can transport you to a singular yet undefinable moment in time where nostalgia lives. It was important for us to speak with William because it’s legacy businesses like Kam Wai that give Chinatown its unique flavour. William chats with us about what it’s like to grow up in Chinatown, to be a queer Chinese man, and the everyday memories that he continues to make and to treasure. You can follow Kam Wai on Instagram @kamwaidimsum."

**CT:** Can you tell us a bit about your relationship with Chinatown?

**W:** Chinatown is special to me because I grew up here on Keefer, right across from Strathcona, and I lived there until I was 29. My parents have had businesses in Chinatown since before I was born, so I was literally born into Chinatown. That’s why it’s so special for me to do business here. It’s just coming back to my roots.

**CT:** How long has Kam Wai been on Pender?

**W:** Kam Wai was established in 1991. My family had different ventures before Kam Wai as well. My dad’s first venture was a bakery on Keefer Street called 龍鳳茶餐廳 (Long Fong Cafe). After that, my parents veered away from the food business, and they had a Chinese antique and jewelry shop at 545 Gore. Then Kam Wai came after.

**CT:** What is your fondest memory of being in Chinatown?

**W:** Growing up, my parents wanted me to go to Chinese school. The only school that had Chinese lessons was St. Francis Xavier, which is on Princess Avenue. After Chinese school, which ended at 4:30PM, I would run straight to where my mom worked, and I would sit down with her, and just drink coffee and have baked goods. Normally that would happen at a place like Goldstone. The fondest memory for me is going straight from school to see my mom and grabbing a bite to eat. It was a ritual for me. That was literally the first meal of the day for my mom, and I got to spend that time with her every single day. It brought me joy every day.

**CT:** Do you still have the first meal with your mom now?

**W:** Yeah, that still happens every day. We have that tradition. I still go with my mom to 飲咖啡 (drink coffee) around 3:30PM.

**CT:** One of the key focuses of this publication is intangible heritage. When you think about Chinatown, are there other ways intangible heritage comes out?

**W:** There are so many intangible elements in Chinatown that I can’t even explain. Just being here in itself is an experience. Growing up, I remember walking through the crowds when it was bustling here. The sounds you would hear, it was just so memorable. I can still hear it in my mind. People yelling at each other, except they weren’t yelling at each other, it was just so loud you had to yell to be heard. And it was such an experience growing up around that. I used to remember all the gonggong pohpohs who would always have candy in their pouches. As a child, you call everybody gonggong and pohpoh, and they would give you candy when you sweet talk them. So I’ve learned to always say hi to your elders and be nice to them, because you’ll get something sweet in return. When you’re walking through the crowds, there are so many smells. The butchers, the seafood mongers, all that fresh seafood. You can also smell the roasted pork going through.Those memories will always stay with me. They’re not something that can be recreated, because you just don’t see or hear that many people in Chinatown anymore, and that’s sad.

**CT:** Kam Wai used to have many more dim sum chefs. What’s changed?

<!-- <img src="kamWai_2of3/> -->

**W:** This, to me, ties into the decline of foot traffic in Chinatown. In the early 90s, when Kam Wai first opened, we had 20 chefs here working until close to midnight. Dim Sum chefs will typically work in their own restaurants from 7 AM to 3 PM, and they have the rest of the day off. We would have had people come in at 3:30 PM, and work until 11 PM or 12 AM at night just to keep up with the demand for our products. At the time frozen dimsum was still really new. It was super convenient, and people knew it was freshly made the day of, especially with the buns. I remember the buns would come out of the steamer, and people would grab them out of the steam trays. They were piping hot, and as a child, I thought it was hilarious, watching adults grab plastic bags and shoving buns into them. That’s a fun memory, seeing people fight over a 叉燒包 (BBQ pork bun).

**CT:** What does resilience mean to you?

**W:** For me,

## resilience is trying to put a positive spin on things. It’s easy to dwell in the past because there were so many great moments in the past.

But with gentrification and everything else, you really need to push through and have a positiveoutlook. There are still businesses out here that thrive, and continue to thrive, like Kam Wai. We
are trying our best to do well, even through the COVID-19 pandemic. I think really it’s just about trying your best to be positive throughout time.

**CT:** Can you tell us about your decision to take over Kam Wai when you had wanted to pursue a Masters degree in opera performance?

**W:** [laughs and sighs] It was a tough decision to make, but at the time it was very easy. My dad had been going through dialysis for a few years, and he had the opportunity to get a new kidney. He was considering selling off the business, because he wouldn’t have been able to take on all the stress of work while in recovery. My dad asked me if I was willing and able to take over. At the time, I was auditioning everywhere in the United States. I put everything down because family is everything to me. It was a personal sacrifice that makes it easier for everyone else in the family, and it means everything to me. If I sacrifice a little bit, it doesn’t detract from anything in my life. I did a lot of training in opera,and it still lives on in me. But there’s a lot of travel that comes with opera, and I’d see way less of my family. I always knew in the back of my mind that the family business would be a backup plan for me, so I always knew that if something had come up in the family, or if opera didn’t work out as a career, I would always have Kam Wai. My family has always been in full support of that. I’m very happy with my decision. My dad is extremely healthy now, he has a new kidney, and he’s way less stressed than he was before because I’ve taken the bulk of the work here.

**CT:** What you said about giving up everything for the family strikes me as such a Chinese and filial thing to say.

**W:** It’s kind of silly when I think about it, but it makes so much sense to me. I guess it really is a cultural thing, isn’t it? Sometimes I wonder if anyone else does this for their family. I grew up with two things: from my mom, it was always to be a useful person, and from my dad it was nothing is impossible. They’d say it in Chinese, so my mom would say “要 做有用人”, and my dad would say “總會有辦法”. I really took these to heart, and always just want to be the best son and best person I could be for everybody. The other thing is you always want to make your parents proud of you. I’m a proud queer man, and I’ve always wanted my parents to be extra proud of me. I’ve always wanted to work extra hard to make them realize that I can still be the son they wanted me to be, as if to make up for it. I know that they are proud of me, and that I’m exactly where they want me to be, but it’s just something that’s always in the back of my mind. It’s the guilt.

**CT:** How has your relationship to Chinatown changed from when you were a child to now, as a business owner?

**W:** When I was a kid, I was just playing around having lunch with my mom. Now I see it as an opportunity to reconnect with the seniors who I met throughout the years. We have so many seniors that come by. They recognize me, and they would tell me they used to go to Long Fong and 飲茶，飲咖啡 (drink tea, drink coffee) with my grandfather. These memories really bring me back and ground me, and make me realize how important Chinatown is to me. I feel like it should be a special place for everybody.

**CT:** Speaking of seniors, throughout quarantine, Kam Wai was making dim sum items for the seniors that live in the May Wah Hotel. Can you tell us more about this?

**W:** Food security in Chinatown is already so precarious, and to be able to get food in Chinatown at affordable prices is becoming more and more difficult. I wanted to be part of the program right away, and I wanted to be able to provide the seniors with a meal that was memorable and that could sustain them throughout the day. We made meals three times a day for a month and a half. I thought it was very successful, and we are happy to be part of it. Sometimes we would make 鹹魚豬肉飯 (salted fish and pork over rice), or other meals I thought they could eat without too much effort and that they would enjoy. It’s a meal I remember eating as a child with my grandparents. It’s such a simple meal, but it is so satisfying because of all the flavours.

**CT:** In what ways have you seen Chinatown change throughout COVID-19? Are there changes in your clientele, or how you market yourself?

**W:** At the very beginning, Chinatown was a ghost town. There was nobody here, and businesses were suffering from that. Then after a month, people started coming back out, and there were fewer seniors, which was nice, because it meant they were staying home. I saw a lot of customers that were buying our frozen products for their parents and grandparents, which was fantastic. April through May were very busy months for us. People were buying out everything on our shelves everyday, looking to fill their freezers, afraid they wouldn’t be able to come out for a while. There have been a lot of closures in Chinatown, and a lot of new businesses have opened up, and they’re businesses that I don’t feel like fit the character of Chinatown. Ever since starting to do business here, I don’t feel like I should be judging people for doing business in Chinatown, but what I can say is that businesses here should have more of an ethical view on Chinatown, and be able to take responsibility for the aftereffects of their businesses. Of course anybody can do business here, but I feel like everybody should have a mindset that can support the seniors in Chinatown and other people that live here. You owe it to them that you can do business here. You also have to be able to provide something that’s affordable for the people that live in Chinatown.

**CT:** What are some ways that Kam Wai can be supported in this time, throughout the pandemic, and whatever the future of Chinatown might look like?

<!-- <img src="kamWai_3of3"/> -->

**W:** I want people to be educated, and for them to learn about Chinatown. I want people to experience Chinatown firsthand. I want them to visit businesses, to talk to business owners, ask them how they’re doing, look at their customers, and try to take it in. I want people to just experience Chinatown and see the folks in Chinatown. I guess that’s not really supporting Kam Wai in particular.

**CT:** It sounds more like supporting Chinatown as a whole, which is so important. What has been your biggest worry throughout the pandemic, and what are the ways in which you’ve been working through it?

**W:** Business-wise, our sales have dropped significantly. In the last five to six years, our business has been going more in the direction of wholesales because the foot traffic in Chinatown just can’t sustain us through retail. Because of the pandemic, wholesale has dropped significantly, and we’ve had to rely on our retail business. Through the first two months, it was great because retail was doing fine, but now it’s slowed down a lot and has gone back to what it was before the pandemic. Our wholesale has dropped by 70% throughout COVID-19. We’ve been trying to build an onlin platform for people to at home so they can do store and curbside pickup, rather than having to come in and dig through everything. We may do a home delivery system in the future if there’s a demand for it.

**CT:** What is your favourite item at Kam Wai, and is a must-try?

**W:** Our 蝦餃 (shrimp dumplings) is the most popular item that sells out the quickest. We only have a limited amount everyday because it’s the most difficult item to make. Our 粽 (sticky rice dumplings) is our second most popular item. We make and sell a lot of it, especially in June during 粽 (sticky rice dumpling) season, both for our own retail and for other retailers. It’s something that gonggong and pohpohs come here all the time to buy because it’s so labourintensive, and nobody wants to make it at home. It really is a lot of work.

**CT:** Speaking of sticky rice dumplings, what does resilience mean to you having had this conversation?

**W:** Resilience means being in the moment, and being able to take it in. Yes, we have to fight through things, but sometimes I feel like we have to have more of a positive outlook in order to bounce back, to be able to pull through and look forward to the future. To have a future, we have to be in the moment and try our best to make the best out of our current situation. As hard as it is, I know my family is trying our hardest to keep things alive in Chinatown, and we’re trying our hardest to keep everyone happy through our business and through our products. That’s as much as I really could do right now.
