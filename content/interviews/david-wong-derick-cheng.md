subtitle: Corning Drugs
order: 8
blurb: "Frontline workers have been critical to our individual and collective well-being throughout the pandemic. Who better to interview about the pandemic, resilience, and Chinatown, than frontline workers who operate Corning Drugs, a pharmacy located at 515 Main Street that’s been operating since 1972? David Wong and his mentor Derick Cheng chat with Chinatown Today about challenges the Chinatown business community face as a result of the pandemic, such as lack of rent subsidy and a changing client demographic. David reminds us that the pandemic is truly a global phenomenon, and that the care we give to one another can be seen through the medical masks we’ve sent, crisscrossing the Pacific, in each others’ times of need."

**CT:** Can you tell us some of your earliest memories of being in Chinatown?

**W:** I remember when I was like 6 or 7, my parents would take me to Chinatown to buy groceries. There were a lot of people on Pender Street, and on the weekends it would be bustling. It’s not the same now. My dad would take us down for breakfast on Sundays. There was this restaurant on Keefer, it’s gone now, but they had a congee special that we would order.

**CT:** It’s similar for me, and it’s sad that the cha chaan tengs (茶餐廳) are gone. Even Goldstone is for sale now.

**W:** I loved their egg tarts! They were the best! But maybe you don’t have to put that in there. [laughs]

**CT:** Anecdotes are always great! What does resilience mean to you in the context of Chinatown?

**W:** To me,

## resilience is the ability to come back. Even though there are many setbacks, you have to fight through it and still come back everyday to serve the community. There are a lot of people here who need our help.

**C:** We have patients coming all the way from Surrey and Richmond, as well as from East Van.

**CT:** There are multiple Corning locations, correct?

**W:** Yes, the demand is there. The Corning on Georgia Street had started with six doctors in that building as well as a blood testing lab in the back. There was also a physiotherapist there, which would have been very convenient for the patients. It’s important to have everything easily accessible especially with the elderly population, because sometimes they have a harder time getting around. This week they finally repaved the sidewalk on Georgia, because the tree roots made it quite uneven. For us young people it’s not that big of a deal, but it’s a hazard for elderly patients who aren’t as agile, especially those that have eye problems like glaucoma. When they were pouring the concrete, this little old lady came in to get her eye drops and she stepped right into the wet concrete because she couldn’t see it was wet cement. The city crew were upset, but they didn’t know she had eye problems. As a young person, you don’t always think about things like this. But as a pharmacist, I always have to put myself in my patients’ shoes.

**C:** Most of the staff in our pharmacies can speak different dialects, which really has its value in Chinatown.

**CT:** In what ways has Corning felt the effects of the COVID-19pandemic?

**W:** The end of January was when we started feeling the effects of the pandemic. People here were scrambling to buy masks to send to their relatives in Hong Kong and China. Before COVID-19, we might sell 2 or 3 boxes of face masks a month at best, but in January we were selling maybe 40 or 50 boxes a day. There was a demand for hand sanitizer, too. I had to take extra time to go elsewhere to source these supplies because our wholesalers were running out. A couple months later, we had our outbreak in Canada. We put up signs and plexiglass overnight, as per regulations. There was a high demand for medication and personal protective equipment March through April, and our supplies were running low because everything halted to a stop around the world. For safety reasons, doctors started to fax or phone in prescriptions more. We started doing more deliveries as well. After work, my staff or I would personally deliver prescription medication out to our customers to ensure they’re safe.

**C:** This is a unique situation. Chinatown merchants can respond to these emergencies because Chinatown is a community with different kinds of businesses that help each other. People come down to Chinatown for banking, doctors, groceries, Chinese medicine, bookstores and all this. It was working very well because it’s like a big market or shopping centre. But now the problem is they take away a lot of business from different sections in the community. So the community has been struggling. That’s also why I’ve been saying the City doesn’t give enough confidence to the local population.

**CT:** What was your biggest worry during this time?

**W:** The COVID-19 virus itself was of course a huge worry. There’s also been an increase in homelessness. When the city shut down during March and April, Chinatown was ghosted. We kept open so I went to work everyday, and I noticed homeless folks would sleep right on main street and outside of our pharmacy. There was a mattress fire a few stores down, and some stores got broken into.

**CT:** What do you think are some challenges Chinatown faces and has faced in the past?

**C:** In terms of the physical space, the problem was with building codes. You couldn’t develop on Pender before, unlike on Keefer, Georgia, and Union, where the building code was more relaxed. Vision Vancouver was very good in the beginning. They listened to all these kinds of ideas, and they relaxed building codes for housing and apartments, which could go up to 12 stories, and 15 with exemptions. There are a lot of people living in poverty here, because people can’t afford to live in other places. The Vancouver Chinatown Merchant’s Association had to hire their own security guards to report about break ins and patrol at night. Chinatown Security has been around for 20 years.

**W:** They’ve been arounds for a while. But even with them, breakins still happen because they can’t stop everything, and they’re not around every second.
**C:** I was so involved in the community because I realized that if the community doesn’t speak out and put pressure on politicians, they won’t pay attention to issues in Chinatown. Chinatown can’t just be old buildings with height restrictions. We are near downtown so there are high taxes, and all these stores are closed down because there’s no incentive for them to reopen.

**W:** Especially for businesses in the Chinatown Plaza. It’s ridiculous. Because of COVID-19, the government offered rent subsidies to the tenants, and it must be applied for through the landlord. But the Plaza belongs to the City, and the City could not apply, even though it’s the landlord.

**C:** We can’t go back in time, and we can’t return to Chinatown in 1986. Chinatown can’t just be used for historical value, to preserve it in a way that is not modernized, sanitary, health conscious, and without security or safety. Also people’s buying habits have changed. You need resources to make this place cleaner, well-developed with more activities, so tourists can come down and enjoy themselves. And not try not to just have the looks. The City also tends to concentrate all the social services in Chinatown. Let’s say the needle exchange program, which is okay, but in the beginning they promised they were going to have more safe injection sites across the city. Chinatown already has a lot of heritage buildings and cultural spaces. It’s good to want to preserve buildings that have cultural and historical value, but that can’t be every building in Chinatown. There is also no bylaw consistency. When I first opened Corning Drugs on Main Street, in the next few years, there were two more drug stores next to me, even though the bylaws say you can’t have the same kind of business within 450m. When the City wants to approve something, they approve it. If not, then they will hold these public meetings and drag it out.

**CT:** What are some ways you would like to be supported? How can the general public support local businesses in Chinatown?

**W:** It’s important to have rent subsidies for the businesses that are trying to survive. I’m blessed because the pharmacy business is relatively stable because people always need their medication. It disheartens me seeing the businesses around us shut down and can’t come back because they don’t have any support. It horrifies me to imagine barely having enough income to pay the rent or the staff. I don’t think I’d be able to sleep.

**C:** You have to give people hope. The City and all these groups have to look and give some hope or some immediate action that shows during this kind of emergency. We need concrete action to help the people here, and not just talk about preserving Chinatown. Policies, regulations, and guidelines need to be set out so people have confidence to endure these kinds of hard times.

**W:** There’s a stigma around Chinatown. People might come down to party on Thursday nights, but they won’t think to come to get a haircut.

**CT:** What is something you’ve been doing throughout quarantine to keep your mental health in check?

**W:** I manage three stores, so life can get very hectic. I practice transcendental meditation to cope with the stress. It helps me a lot with everything going on. Everyone is going through similar stresses, but I don’t think that everyone knows how to handle it or have the tools to do so. I think meditation is just a great way to cope. I was regularly practicing prior to COVID-19, and I’m very thankful for my practice. I don’t know how I’d be maintaining sanity without it. Everyone has their own way, and some people may use methods that aren’t as beneficial, such as alcohol or other substances. It’s easy to think of substance users as bad people, but maybe they went through hardships, and didn’t have the tools, the support, or family to help them get through it. Sometimes when you mess up once it just kind of spirals.

**CT:** I really like that point. It’s important to be empathetic and to understand that everyone has their own lived experiences and perspectives, and that we need to be mindful of where people might be coming from. Is there anything else you’d like to add?

**C:** The government keeps looking the other way. They’re not concerned about making Chinatown viable or prosperous, and they ignore our problems altogether. We want to be able to stay in Chinatown and do well, whether it be emotionally, socially, or financially, and we need help from the City.
