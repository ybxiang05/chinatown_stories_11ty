**CT:** What is your relationship to Chinatown?

**M:** I grew up running around in the Chau Luen building and in Chinatown.. When my family first came here, we lived in the building right across from the Chinese Cultural Centre, six of us in a single room on the second floor. After we moved out of Chinatown, I’d still visit all the time because my great aunt lived in the Chau Luen building. She would babysit me, even after we moved to Surrey. I took kung fu lessons with the Chau Luen Athletic Club when I was a teenager, and got more involved over time. Now I teach kung fu and lion dance at the Athletic Club, and I’m a director at Chau Luen Society. I’m also one of the inaugural co-chairs of the Chinatown Legacy Stewardship Group, which is a City of Vancouver committee meant to promote collaboration between Chinatown communities, and to help shape how the City of Vancouver staff, specifically the Chinatown Transformation Team, proceeds with the UNESCO World Heritage Site application.

**CT:** Do you have a fondest memory of Chinatown?

**M:** My fondest memory is attending the Lunar New Year parades as a child in the audience and seeing the firecrackers. I still remember the smells. I also have lots of great memories of going for dim sum in Chinatown with my great aunt. Because I was the baby of the family, she’d always spoil me. She’d order two plates of beef rolls, one for the table, and one just for me. We used to go to a place on Pender called 龍鳳茶餐廳 (Long Fong Cafe). They had sugar and cream on the side, so you could just order regular tea and make milk tea yourself.

**CT:** Has your perception of Chinatown changed between now and then?

**M:** What’s changed is the foot traffic, and the feeling that Chinatown is a busy part of the city. One of the things I miss the most is the noise and sounds. Back then, when you walked down the street, the produce stores would have an uncle yelling “fresh veggies” in Toisanese or Cantonese. I miss that. There are other aspects that are still around in different ways, like lion dancing and lots of good restaurants, but I miss the sounds the most.

**CT:** Can you tell us about your journey with lion dance and kung fu?

**M:** When my family lived in Chinatown, we would hear the Hon Hsing Athletics Club practice drumming on the floor above us. As far as noisy neighbours go, they were probably the worst, but as a kid, I thought it was amazing. My sisters still tell me about how I would throw a blanket over myself and pretend to lion dance. My family moved to Surrey soon after, and when I was old enough to take the skytrain, I’d attend lion dance and kung fu classes at Chau Luen. When I was going to university, I started to notice there were fewer people interested. Maybe it wasn’t considered cool at the time, but our group is very passionate about it.

<blockquote>I joke about it being Chinese guilt. No one else is around to do this, so you feel this responsibility to keep it going. Even my parents don’t always understand why we keep going. But if we don’t do it, who else is going to do it?</blockquote>

I feel a responsibility to not only be a practitioner but to teach and promote it to the next generation.

**CT:** Are there ways in which the significance of lion dance has changed for you over the past two decades?

**M:** It’s grown on me. As I get older, I gain a deeper understanding of just how special it is to be able to do it in Chinatown. Over the last few years, I’ve seen an increase in engagement with Chinatown as a space, as well as in the intangible heritage here, which is comforting. Lion dancing is very ceremonial and traditional. The techniques and the practice of the ceremony itself have stayed the same, but the interest is starting to change. People seem to view it differently as they come to understand more about how unique it is.

**CT:** What does resilience mean in light of the greater interest in lion dancing?

**M:** Even in the word itself, resilience has that character of continuing on in the face of adversity. In many kung fu styles there is a set named after the plum blossom. And it’s not just martial arts organizations; a lot of Chinese societies use the plum blossom as part of their symbol or logo design. The plum blossom is one of the few flowers that thrives in winter amidst the snow when there’s nothing else in bloom. When we talk about resilience, I think about the plum blossom, I think about kung fu, and I think about lion dance. Resilience is being able to thrive through adversity, and it all comes together in the symbol of the plum blossom. To me, it’s a trait that’s always been there in us. You just don’t really see it or understand it until someone points it out.

**CT:** In what ways have you been affected by COVID-19? Have your interactions with Chinatown changed because of it?

**M:** It’s much more difficult to visit and maintain a connection to Chinatown now. When I lived in Vancouver, I used to visit Chinatown two or three times a week. Now it’s decreased to once or twice a month. One of the big reasons I would go to Chinatown was to teach kung fu class. We had to pause all activity for the bulk of the pandemic. Even though we recently started holding class again, they’re not in our usual location in the Chau Luen Tower, because we need to protect the Chinese senior residents there. I’m still doing some advocacy work throughout the pandemic, but it’s very different doing it from a distance. My wife and I still make the point to go to Chinatown to pick things up when we can, but we have to be very intentional about it.

**CT:** Can you tell us more about the Chau Luen Society?

**M:** Chau Luen is a Chinatown clan society. Most clan societies are organized around a common surname or hometown in China. Chau Luen is organized around five last names. We’ve been around for almost 80 years. We were originally located at Union and Main. In the 60s, as part of the teardown for the viaduct and policies around that time, we were forced to relocate. In 1973, we established the Chau Luen Tower as it is right now, which is an apartment complex at Keefer and Gore that has 82 units for low-income seniors right in Chinatown. Each unit has its own kitchen and bathroom so we could take care of the seniors, while they can still go grocery shopping and live independently with friends. I’ve always been proud of our focus on seniors’ housing. My great aunt, grandfather, and grandmother all lived there during their lifetimes, and it’s one of the biggest reasons I got involved with the society beyond the athletic club. That’s always been the nearest and dearest to my heart.

**CT:** Can you tell us more about the lion visits in the tower around Lunar New Year?

**M:** Around Lunar New Year, we go floor to floor to visit every resident, with consent of course. Lion dancing is a blessing ceremony, during which you make an offering for the lion. The elders in the building would put up little candies, fruit, and sometimes a red pocket, and the lion would go door to door, kind of like Lunar New Year trick or treating. I actually don’t know how that came about. I didn’t think anything of it for a long time. It wasn’t until someone else pointed out how unique it is that I realized it’s not done elsewhere. It’s one of those traditions you do without asking why just because it’s so fun for everyone involved. The seniors’ faces always light up when we visit, and there’s one floor of seniors who are very proud of always having the most participation.

**CT:** How do you see resilience in your role with the LSG compared when you’re doing community work with Chau Luen?

**M:** When you work with an organization like the LSG, it’s important to remember that the things you talk about have real impact. It’s easier to remember what being in Chinatown feels like during meetings when you’re walking the streets all the time. Sometimes it can be hard to remember why you’re meeting when you’re debating policies and programs all day. Being resilient on that front means remembering that the reason you’re there is so you can have a wider influence to help shape policies that will affect the people in Chinatown.

**CT:** What has been the biggest worry for you during this pandemic?

**M:** As a director at Chau Luen, my biggest concern was that the outbreaks have been in assisted living facilities for seniors. Because Chau Luen is an unassisted living building, we don’t have the same level of control over visitors or distancing practices that an assisted living facility would. We haven’t had any issues, and we’re proud of that. The other concern for me is the cultural legacy businesses in Chinatown that have been hit hard, and are still at risk right now. One of the campaigns I took a lead on was advocating for a bailout for Chinatown. Granville Island, which is a traditionally white neighbourhood that’s tourism based and culturally significant to Vancouver, received \$17M in federal funding separate from government funding for small businesses elsewhere. Chinatown is similar but historically disadvantaged, and there’s nothing coming for Chinatown. The UNESCO World Heritage Site bid is predicated on the intangible cultural heritage of Chinatown. The architecture is only a small part of it. The intangible heritage that makes Chinatown unique is all the activities carried out by the people, businesses, organizations, and societies here. If these culturally appropriate organizations and legacy businesses disappear, they’re gone forever, and we wouldn’t have a chance to bid for UNESCO.

**CT:** What are some ways people outside of the community can help?

**M:** Just go to Chinatown. Pick up some pastries. Go grocery shopping. Pick up some takeout. That’s the easiest way for someone to really help Chinatown out right now. LSG is continuing to work on larger scale approaches. One of the projects right now focuses on how to engage the city to highlight Chinatown, and to give it more support. It’s about helping people realize the danger Chinatown is in. We’ve been previously engaged with both the City and the federal government, now we’re coming up with some ground level initiatives through working to mobilize people.

**CT:** 2020 has been a garbage fire, but it also has been a year of changemaking. One of the bigger movements of the year has been Black Lives Matter, and some of the protests went through Chinatown. Chau Luen Society was on the same block as Hogan’s Alley Society prior to the viaduct. Can you speak on these working relationships?

**M:** In the past, the broader Chinese Canadian community had stronger relationships with other racialized communities. Over time, through different factors, those relations have weakened. Chinatown needs to do better to build stronger relationships with Hogan’s Alley.

<blockquote>There’s a lot of work that needs to be done for all the neighbourhoods, like the Downtown Eastside and Hogan’s Alley, in terms of social programming and planning. The Black Lives Matter movement gives our community an opportunity to have an important dialogue about racism with an inward gaze. It’s hard to have that conversation with another community when you yourself don’t recognize what’s happening to them, as well as the role you have played in these happenings yourself.</blockquote>

There is also lots of work to be done with the Northeast False Creek development plan, which will impact Hogan’s Alley and Chinatown. We need to make sure everyone who is a stakeholder in that plan is at the table during the dialogue.

**CT:** Are there specific ways in which the Chinatown community can support other racialized folks, whether it be in the Black Lives Matter movement, or when it comes to policing in the Downtown Eastside?

**M:** I think people need to become more educated about how police treat different marginalized communities differently. Black and Indigenous communities are overrepresented in police statistics. There’s a significant number of folks in the Chinatown community who advocate for the safety and security of our neighbourhood, and the go-to answer is always “we need more police on the street to make people feel comfortable enough to come down to Chinatown”. But policing isn’t the best way to address the situation, though it’s the easiest to say. The hard questions are how do we treat mental illness? How do we treat drug addiction? What about homelessness? How do we attack the cause rather than the symptom? We can’t just displace the issue from one neighbourhood to another. We need to actually fix it. Sometimes I think people perceive a divide between Chinatown and some of the other communities, but it’s important to think about how that wasn’t always the case, or might not be the case. When we speak of the communities inside Chinatown, we’re also speaking about the Japanese and Filipino communities. The Hindustan Times, a very well-known newspaper, operated out of Chinatown. Even the Italian community, now well-known, didn’t start on Commercial Drive; they started in Chinatown. The way that I see it, and a lot of the elders tell me so as well, Chinatown was just the catch-all name. It wasn’t just Chinese people living there. Chinatown was a space for everyone who wasn’t white, and who were marginalized. We need to break down barriers and preconceived notions that we’re separate communities, when historically that hasn’t been the case. We need to educate ourselves and understand the relationships these neighbourhoods have and have had in the past.
