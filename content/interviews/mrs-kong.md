order: 6
blurb: "Mrs. Kong has been a part of the Chinatown neighbourhood for almost a quarter of a century. As a member of the Chinatown Concern Group, Mrs. Kong has been adamant about speaking out against the gentrification of Chinatown. In 2017, her fiery speech at City Hall in opposition to the 105 Keefer project earned her the hearts of Chinatown youths and community organizers alike. Mrs. Kong tells Chinatown Today about the immediate needs of the Chinese senior communities in Chinatown, why Chinese folks should support Indigenous peoples in so-called Canada, and what she loves about hanging out with diasporic Chinese youth. If you want to read about some wholesome intergenerational bonding, this is an interview you don’t want to miss. Additionally, if you speak Cantonese or Mandarin and want to spend some quality time making dumplings, playing mahjong, and singing karaoke with cool Chinese seniors like Mrs. Kong, get in touch with the Yarrow Intergenerational Society for Justice."

**CT:** 您在唐人街住多久了？
**CT:** How long have you lived in Chinatown?

**K:** 二十幾多年了。我 1994 年來的，到加拿大兩三年就來唐人街住了。我是廣東湛江人。
**K:** More than twenty years I came to Canada in 1994, and moved to Chinatown two or three years after. I’m from Zhanjiang in Guangdong.

**CT:** 您跟家人来的吗？
**CT:** Did you come here with family?

**K:** 我通过女兒申請來。我和老公來了十幾天她就回香港了。我們兩公婆在這裏做洗碗工，做家庭清潔。那時候可以做，什麼工作都做過。在大陸的時候做過很多生 意。
**K:** My daughter applied for me to come. My daughter went back to Hong Kong about a week after my husband and I arrived. The two of us made a living working as dishwashers and house cleaners. I was able to work then, and we worked lots of different jobs. We ran different businesses in China before coming here.

**CT:** 您為什麼選擇來加拿大？
**CT:** Why did you choose to come to Canada?

**K:** 我喜歡加拿大，因為我女兒在这里。这里民主。大陸政策運動多，不知道會怎麼样。我有五個子女。我常擔心他們，擔心學校造反，作為父母害怕。在这里，我夠膽上市政廳提意見了，所有地方都重視老人有沒有來，在大陸才不會。而且我喜歡這裡氣候。
**K:** I love Canada because my daughter was here. It’s democratic here. There was a lot of political shift in China, you never know what’s going to happen. I have five children, and I was always worried about them, worried about their education. As parents, we were scared. Here, I have been able to make my opinions heard at city hall, and at the meetings they care about seniors. That wouldn’t happen in China. I also like the climate here.

**CT:** 您在唐人街最早或最喜歡的記憶是什麼？
**CT:** What is your earliest or fondest memory of Chinatown?

**K:** 最喜歡就以前的旺盛，很熱鬧，有很多間買菜的，那時候有華埠超級市場。所以按我看法，政府沒有理由不理唐人街，因為是唐人的中心，他不會收的，唐人街應 該會發展的，只是因為現在疫症關係無法搞，唐人街收檔就沒成唐人街了。
**K:** I liked the vibrancy from before, the atmosphere was hot and noisy. Chinatown was flourishing, there were a lot of places to get groceries; at the time Chinatown Supermarket was still here. From my point of view, the government has no reason to neglect Chinatown. Chinatown acts as a gathering place for Chinese people. It can’t be lost. Chinatown should continue to be developed, but it’s so hard with the COVID-19 pandemic. Chinatown won’t be Chinatown anymore if things keep closing.

**CT:** 在您居住在唐人街這段時間以來，您有發現什麼改變嗎？
**CT:** Since you’ve come to live in the Chinatown community, how have you seen it change?

**K:** 我們初來的時候很熱鬧。現在差得遠了。
**K:** When we first came, the neighbourhood was very vibrant and lively. It’s very different now.

**CT:** 您是否希望唐人街恢復舊時候那樣？我有留意到現在不少年輕的唐人有在唐人街開一些店。雖然不像以前的那些店，可是還是唐人開的，你有什麼看法？
**CT:** Do you wish that Chinatown was back to the way it was before? I see a lot of younger Chinese people opening shops. They’re not like the shops as before, but they’re still Chinese owned and operated. What do you think about this?

**K:** 當然希望是同聲同氣的，現在有的一條雪糕都要五六元，誰會吃？現在餐館少。 老人家要一盅兩件，貴的怎樣吃得下，退休金哪裡會夠吃呢？需要適應唐人。我當然希望興旺的，廉價的，讓退休的能享受到。需要為老人打算。
**K:** Of course I hope they’re like-minded people. There is a place now that sells ice cream for $5 or $6. Who can afford that? There are fewer restaurants now. Seniors just need a cup of tea and a couple side dishes. How can we afford the expensive restaurants with just our old age security? Places in Chinatown need to be suited to Chinese people. Of course I hope Chinatown can be vibrant and economical, so even those who are retired can have the means to enjoy living here. These new shops need to think about the seniors.

**CT:** 您聽到唐人街這個詞會想到什麼？
**CT:** What do you think of when you hear the term Chinatown?

**K:** 唐人街是唐人最重要的中心。紀念碑都在那裡，加上是個旅遊點，哪裡來都會來唐人街參觀的。將來興旺是我心想的，但是我的看法就是肯定會倒塌。我看這形勢，政府都沒有什麼重視。
**K:** Chinatown is the most important gathering place for Chinese people. The memorials are there, and Chinatown is a tourist attraction. When people all over the world come to Vancouver, they come to visit Chinatown. I want Chinatown to thrive in the future, but in my view, it will collapse. The government hasn’t paid it attention.

**CT:** 是因為疫情還是其他問題？
**CT:** Is it because of the pandemic or other issues?

**K:** 是因為疫情一回事，更沒可說，我都沒有出外。加拿大政府好的地方就是很照顧我們老人。但是大局來講，唐人街長時間都搞不好，疫情時間沒有重視。附近只有一個超市，很多地方都收了。現在情況越來越差。我希望三級政府重視，搞好唐人街。我初時很大的信心唐人街不會倒，但現在看這個形勢都很危機。個人做不到什麼，一定要集中在這裡的社團。因為我喜歡唱歌跳舞，我以前到處都去。現在什麼都沒有。疫情難講，但今次疫情來講，我对這裡的社團很滿足。有社工幫我們買菜，送菜送到門口，十元一個星期買來自己付錢的菜。有的是政府付。什麼都要政府資助。最重要是重視和發動群眾。
**K:** The pandemic is one thing, that’s for sure, I haven’t even gone outside. The good thing about the government is that they treat seniors very well. But broadly speaking, Chinatown is a long term project and it hasn’t gotten proper attention, especially during the pandemic. There’s only one greengrocer left in Chinatown, and a lot of places are closed. The situation is deteriorating. I hope all three levels of government would pay attention to what’s happening in Chinatown, and to actively invest in it. I used to be confident that Chinatown will survive, but we are in a crisis. We can’t do much individually. We need to rally the community organizations. I like to sing and dance, so I used to be very social. There’s nothing now. The pandemic is difficult to predict, but on the topic of the pandemic, seeing the way that community organizations have come together has made me feel whole. We have a volunteer who helps us buy fresh vegetables and deliver them to our doors for only \$10 a week. Some is subsidized by the government. We need funding from the government to support us. The most important thing is for the government to pay attention and to mobilize the general population.

**CT:** 我希望未來這幾年會有變化，希望年青人回來振興，做的會有幫助。
**CT:** I hope there will be changes in the next few years, and that young people will come back to revitalize Chinatown, to be helpful to the community.

**K:** 是啊，現在也很多義工，青年男女，都做很多工作。但要出錢才可以。
**K:** Yes, currently there are a lot of youth volunteers who are doing a lot. But there needs to be funding to keep this work going.

**CT:** 您認為新冠肺炎對唐人街的未來會有什麼影響？
**CT:** How do you think the pandemic will impact the future of Chinatown?

**K:** 大影響。沒得出門口，老人家又病多，政府又消耗，醫藥費多。我們真的聽話門口沒有出，我們這棟樓都是老人家很少出去。不過有一個星期送一次青菜來，特別我們有病的送到房門。以前我們出去又打太極，又打劍，又跳舞，起碼有活動。最緊要，提意見組織多找年輕人幫帶老人家看病。唐人街應該政府要重視才可以。三級政府要願意調動金錢才可以。
**K:** It’ll have a huge impact. No one can go out, and us seniors are prone to illness. The government has a lot of expenditure on medical expenses. The seniors in our building take the regulations very seriously, and we don’t go out. We just have groceries delivered to our door once a week, especially for those that are ill. We used to go out for Tai Chi, sword exercises, and dance. At least we got to move around. The most important thing is I suggest for the organizations to find more young people to accompany seniors to see doctors. Chinatown needs attention, support, and funding from all levels of government.

**CT:** 您覺得現在唐人街最需要什麼？
**CT:** What do you think Chinatown needs the most right now?

**K:** 最緊要買菜。我們有病，去大統華都辛苦。那天我去日升，推車仔去，在 Hastings 跌了一跤。幸好沒有斷骨，暈了一下，後腦破了一個洞。在醫院时我心跳太慢，心臟開了刀放起搏器進去，現在也還沒有痊癒。
**K:** We need help with grocery shopping. We are ill, and even going to T&T is a huge challenge. The other day I was walking along Hastings Street with my shopping cart to go to Sunrise Market, and I fell. Luckily I didn’t break any bones, but I fainted, and hit the back of my head. When I was at the hospital, my heart rate was too low. They had to operate on my heart and put in a pacemaker. I haven’t fully recovered yet.

**CT:** 那麼我不阻你太久了。你累了告訴我。
**CT:** Then I won’t take too much of your time. Let me know if you are tired.

**K:** 沒問題，跟你講話沒問題，很精神，但是走出去丟垃圾都很辛苦，走路道氣頂上來很辛苦。
**K:** It‘s okay, I can still carry on this conversation with no problem, but it’s hard to walk around, even to take out the garbage. I have difficulty breathing, especially while walking.

**CT:** 您對『無形文化遺產』這個詞是什麼看法？不一定是建築或物件，但您覺得什麼算是遺產？有些人認為人的關係，吃的，都是文化遺產，雖然城市講大建築多。您覺得呢？
**CT:** What are your thoughts around intangible heritage? It doesn’t have to be buildings or things, but what do you consider to be heritage? Some people think heritage is also people’s relationships and the foods they eat, even though the city mainly talks about historical buildings. What do you think?

**K:** 當然了，文化和歷史，像紀念的地方，像文化中心，孫中山公園，那些都應該繼續發展下去等多一點人去觀看中國的文化歷史。
**K:** Of course, the culture and history, like memorials, like the Chinese Cultural Centre, and Dr. Sun Yat Sen Garden, those should continue to be developed so that more people can go visit and see Chinese culture and history.

**CT:** 你覺得政府可以如何幫我們學這些？
**CT:** How do you think the government can help us learn about these?

**K:** 開班吧，我們老人家不知道很多的，又不在這裡出生。多一點班，找年輕人來教，來學。可以這樣學習文化。現在有很多大學生，叫他們做義工，開班。最好搞一些英文課，中文課。很多老人家不會英文，又不記得中文是真的。但是現在疫情都沒有人能出去。
**K:** They should start some classes; even many seniors don’t know, because we weren’t born here. More classes, find young people to teach and take classes. You can learn about culture this way. There are a lot of university students, get them to volunteer, and start classes. It would be best to have some English and Chinese lessons, too. Lots of seniors can’t speak English, and it’s an ever greater challenge when we can’t remember Chinese either. But because of the pandemic now, no one can go out.

**CT:** 最近有很多遊行抗議。您有聽說嗎？
**CT:** There have been a lot of protests lately. Have you heard anything?

**K:** 是不是土住民？我們就應該幫他們的，有什麼都幫。
**K:** Is it about Indigenous people? We should help and support them however we can.

{% contentImage "mrsKong_3of4.jpg", "" %}

**CT:** 你覺得為什麼要幫助？
**CT:** Why do you think we should support them?

**K:** 因為土地是他們的。不公平的。我們應該幫助他們的，我們參加很多抗議的。我們同情他們，唐人街關注組有參加抗議的。
**K:** Because the land is theirs. It is unfair. We should support them and participate in more protests. We empathize with them, and participated in a lot of protests through the Chinatown Concern Group.

**CT:** 你覺得其他老人家也是一樣想的？
**CT:** Do you think other seniors think this way, too?

**K:** 是，關注組很多人都參加抗議的。同情因為土地是屬於原住民的。我們支持。
**K:** Yes. A lot of people from the Chinatown Concern Group participate in the protests. We sympathize with them, because the land belongs to the Indigenous people. We support them.

**CT:** 你有沒有想這個疫情還會多久？
**CT:** Have you thought about how long the pandemic will last?

**K:** 我沒有想，但是聽說會到明年。聽華僑之聲常說會到明年。我以前踩單車的，住列治文的時候，兩公婆在富大洗碗，騎單車到 Granville 街尾要兩個小時。我以前常踩的，有了孫我女兒就不讓我踩。我今年八十八歲了。
**K:** I didn’t think about it, but I hear it will last until next year. The Chinese-language radio station said it will be next year. I used to bike everywhere when I used to live in Richmond. My husband and I washed dishes at Floata, so we would bike to the end of Granville. It takes two hours. I used to ride a lot, but since my daughter had my grandson, she didn’t want me to bike anymore. I am 88 years old this year.

**CT:** 你一天內會做什麼？
**CT:** What do you do during your day now?

{% contentImage "mrsKong_4of4.jpg", "" %}

**K:** 有什麼做！又不敢出門口，就在家打兩下太極拳，看戲，聽新聞。有時候走走，站站，這樣繼續下去真會骨軟。好悶，有些老人家有打電話聊天，沒有到訪。如果繼續下去真的骨都軟了。我有電視，朋友給我影帶，影碟，我沒事做就看戲。我喜歡看戲，喜歡唱卡拉 OK，但是擔心吵到別人，疫情沒有唱。我以前會和年輕人一起，做水餃吃，唱歌，但是疫情所以沒有了。
**K:** What is there to do? I am afraid of going out, so I just do some Tai Chi at home, watch some TV, listen to the news. Sometimes I walk around or stand for a bit, or else my body will become weak. When I feel bored, some seniors would phone and we chat for a bit, but no visits. If this goes on my bones will get soft. I have a TV. Friendsgave me tapes and DVDs, and I watch them when I have nothing to do. I like to watch movies and shows and sing karaoke, but I’m worried about being too loud and bothering others so I don’t sing during the pandemic. I used to spend time with young people, we would make dumplings and sing karaoke, but not during the pandemic.

**CT:** 和年輕人在一起開心嗎？
**CT:** Does it make you happy to spend time with young people?

**K:** 很有意義的。
**K:** It’s very meaningful.

**CT:** 為什麼有意義？
**CT:** Why is it meaningful?

**K:** 後生一輩什麼都新鮮，我們老鬼開心。我到處都去的，和活躍。像他們在紀念碑打麻將我也有去，打麻將唱卡拉 OK。我喜歡和他們在一起，他們也喜歡和我在一起。
**K:** Everything is new and refreshing with the younger generation, and it makes us old folks happy. I used to be very social and go everywhere. I’d go when they had mahjong and karaoke at the memorial square. I like being with them, and they like to be with me, too.

**CT:** 你希望他們在老人家身上學到什麼？
**CT:** What do you hope they can learn from seniors?

**K:** 學中國文化，唱歌，跳舞，我喜歡跳舞。他們打麻將每次都去捧場。
**K:** I hope they learn about Chinese culture, and sing and dance. I like to dance. I go watch them play mahjong every time.

**CT:** 你有沒有在年輕人身上學到什麼？
**CT:** Have you learned anything new from the youth?

**K:** 有，很多。他們活躍，跟他們在一起很開心，好講好笑。每年我生日請兩圍都是關注組的。我喜歡跟年輕人一起，他們也喜歡和我一起。一起唱歌，一起煮飯，我很開心。有些是大陸來的，他們學生沒有湯喝，所以我煮湯包水餃。我喜歡知道你需要什麼想什麼，我幫忙。在這裡養老都辛苦的，所以能歡喜就好，有歌唱就好。
**K:** Yes, lots. They’re lively, and being with them is a good time. There’s lots to talk and laugh about. Every year on my birthday, I invite people from the Chinatown Concern Group to celebrate. I like to be with them, and they like to be with me. It makes me happy when we sing and cook together. Some of them are students from mainland China, and most students don’t get to have homemade soup often, so I make soup and dumplings for them. I like to ask what they miss the most, so that I can help them feel more at home. Retirement can be a struggle, but it’s enough to be happy together, and to sing together.
