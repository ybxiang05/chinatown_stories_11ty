title: Li Yu Rong
subtitle: 李玉荣
order: 15
blurb: "Like many transplants here, Mrs. Li fell in love with Vancouver for its temperate climate and crisp air. In this charmingly endearing conversation, Mrs. Li tells us how she communicates with Cantonese-speaking seniors as a Mandarin-speaker, why it’s important to support the Black Lives Matter movement, and how Chinese Canadian history is inextricably intertwined with Indigenous knowledge and generosity. Editors aren’t supposed to play favourites, but this is an interview you will want to read."

**CT:** 请您告诉我们您叫什么名字，在唐人街住多久了？
**CT:** Please tell us your name, and how long you’ve lived in Chinatown

**L:** 我叫李玉荣，我 2004 年来了加拿大， 到现在十多年了。我一来就很喜欢这个地方。这里空气好，人也少。环境卫生非常好。我喜欢加拿大的环境。又不冷，又不热，到处都是花园。非常卫生，非常干净。
**L:** My name is Li Yu Rong. I came to Canada in 2004, and I’ve been here for more than 10 years. I’ve liked this place from the beginning. The air is fresh here, and there’s fewer people. The environment is very good. I like the environment in Canada. It’s not too cold, and not too hot, and there are flowers and gardens everywhere. It’s safe and clean.

**CT:** 您听到唐人街这个词会想到什么？
**CT:** What do you think about when you hear the term Chinatown?

**L:** 我原来在美树堂住，就来唐人街买东西。我那时候我看见唐人街和我们中国的街道上，小巷里头是一模一样的。我就非常感慨，他们把中国的东西都搬到这里来了。买东西的时候，粮油这么的比中国卖的还全。豆腐呀，炸酱呀，什么都有。日升卖的菜和中国的是一模一样的，还新鲜，人还少，又卫生。中国人多，新鲜东西来了很快就抢光了。
**L:** When I used to live in Maple Ridge, I’d come to Chinatown to do my shopping. At that time, I remember thinking how similar the streets of Chinatown are to streets in China. I had so many feelings: they transported all these Chinese things here! When I buy groceries, the staples I can find here have even more variety than in China. There’s tofu, cooking sauces, everything. The produce sold in Sunrise Market is exactly the same as in China, and even fresher, more sanitary. There are so many people in China that when anything good and fresh are supplied, they’re gone in minutes.

**CT:** 您是中国哪里来的？
**CT:** Which part of China are you from?

**L:** 我家乡是山东青岛的。我是青岛人。在青岛环境卫生也还不错，但比不上这里。毕竟人少。
**L:** My ancestral home is in Qingdao, Shandong. I’m from Qingdao. The environment in Qingdao is good, also, but it’s not as good as here as there are fewer people here.

**CT:** 对您来说，唐人街意味着什么？
**CT:** What does Chinatown mean to you?

**L:** 唐人街就是意味着华人的文化发展。我们华人来到这里，广东人讲广东话没有变样。讲国语的来这儿讲国语也没有变样。我们带着我们的华人的文化来唐人街。唐人的文化在加拿大没有改变。我在这里不懂英语照样可以和华人交流。我觉得这要感谢先移民的华裔们，感谢他们为我们在加拿大创造了这么好的条件让我们来可以在这里生活。
**L:** Chinatown signifies the cultural development of the Chinese diaspora. When the Chinese come here, those who speak Cantonese still speak Cantonese, and those who speak Mandarin still speak Mandarin. We brought our Chinese culture to Chinatown, and that hasn’t changed, even in Canada. I can’t speak English, but I can still communicate with the Chinese people here. I am deeply grateful to the first generations of Chinese diaspora. It’s thanks to them that we have such good living opportunities in Canada.

**CT:** 这里好多华人讲的都是广东话，您听得懂吗？
**CT:** A lot of Chinese folks here speak Cantonese, but you speak Mandarin. Are there communication issues?

**L:** 我是和他们相处的惯了。我们会说你好，她会叫我到她家里坐坐。这些我和楼里的老人都能交流。但是要是说的很多了我就听不懂了。她说广东话，我说国语。我也能猜她说了什么，也能了解。这和英语不一样。要讲英语我就根本不懂了。
**L:** We’re used to being with each other. We’ll say hello, and they would signal for me to visit them in their home. I can communicate simply with a lot of the elders in my building, but if they speak too much or too fast, then I can’t understand them. They speak Cantonese, I speak Mandarin. But I can still guess what they’re saying, and I can understand that way. This is different from English. I can’t understand English at all.

**CT:** 您生活在唐人街最开心的回忆是什么？
**CT:** What’s your happiest memory in Chinatown?

**L:** 最开心的回忆就是可以跟同龄的人相处。我住本拿比和美树堂的时候没有同龄的家乡人可以聚一聚，聊个天，说个话。在这里，我很开心有同龄的老太太可以谈家常。比如说，你跟谁来的，你家儿子几个孩子，你姑娘在哪里啦，国内还有孩子吗？就是唠家常，什么都说。在这儿生活的习惯吗？在家里每天做什么饭啊？就是老太太的话。虽然只是一些老太太的话，可是我在这里找到这么多人跟我有共同语言。但是和广东人讲话只能是你好，再见。没有人讲话是一件很孤独的事情，也不开心，会想家。我有段时间我有想回去，住两年就回中国半年。现在不是了。
**L:** My happiest memory is just being around people my own age. When I lived in Burnaby and Maple Ridge, I didn’t have anyone with the same language background who I could get together with, to chat with. But here, I’m happy to have old ladies my age to talk about our daily lives. For example, we ask questions like, “who did you come to Canada with? How many kids does your son have? Where is your daughter?” and “Do you still have kids in China?” It’s just everyday conversation, but we talk about everything. “Have you gotten used to living here? What do you cook everyday?” It’s old lady talk. But even though it’s only old lady talk, I’m so glad I found so many people with the same language. When I speak with Cantonese folks, it’s limited to hello and goodbye. Having nobody to talk with is a very lonely thing. I wouldn’t be happy and would be homesick. There was a period when I would live here for two years and live in China for six months and alternate that way. Not anymore.

**CT:** 您在唐人街最早的记忆是什么？
**CT:** What’s your oldest memory in Chinatown?

**L:** 我在唐人街的第一印象是 2006 年。2006 年市政府要来拆唐人街。唐人街一进大门从 Georgia 上了桥，两边都是买东西的。到西边盖了一些高楼。那个时候西边有卖叉烧肉，卖叉烧包的，都是吃的。市政府把那里都拆掉了。后来来了些年轻人，他们都是早期移民的后代。他们帮助我们做翻译，很好。我们去市政府开会，都是他们帮我们翻译。后来市政府老是来唐人街开会。他们要拆唐人街的房子，我们不让他们拆。他们要号召老百姓拆房子，买房子，不让你在这里住了。他们要用唐人街地盘盖高楼。好多人都搬走了。叉烧肉也搬走了。那叉烧肉可好了，我们经常去唐人街买来吃。现在没有了。后来就是这些年轻人来反对。唐人街是我们唐人的，用我们唐人的劳动来建立了这个地方。这里本来有水的，华人把它建平了，弄好了，在这里居住。华人的粮，油，吃的菜，只要是华人吃的东西，这里都有。唐人街不能拆。当年老人和年轻人都在一起开会，讨论到底让不让他们拆。后来这些年轻人不让他们拆。那时候唐人街住的是穷人，华人和原住居民。原住居民是最受歧视的。华人在这里要交人头税也是受歧视的。当时原住民也起来反对。
**L:** My first memory of Chinatown was 2006 when the City wanted to takedown buildings in Chinatown. When you first get into Chinatown from Georgia Street, there used to be shops on either side. Now there are tall buildings to the west, condos at Main and Keefer. Back then the shops used to sell barbeque pork, barbeque pork buns, and other foods. The city tore it all down. Then some Chinese youths came to help. They were descendents of the early Chinese diaspora. They helped us translate when we spoke to government officials. It was great. We attended meetings with the City and depended on them to translate for us. The City kept having meetings about Chinatown. They wanted to tear down the houses and buildings, and we didn’t let them. They wanted residents to tear down their homes, sell their homes, because the government didn’t want people to live here anymore. They wanted to use the space to build condos. Lots of people moved away. The barbeque pork shop also moved away. Their barbeque pork was very, very good, we would often go all the way to Chinatown from Maple Ridge to buy it. But it’s gone. Chinatown is ours. Chinatown was built on the labour and toil of the Chinese diaspora. There used to be water here, but the early Chinese settlers made it livable. Culturally appropriate staples and groceries can all be found here. You can’t tear down Chinatown. That year, the elders and the youths all came together to discuss whether we should let them tear down Chinatown. The young generation didn’t allow them to tear it down. At that time, Chinatown was inhabited by the poor, Chinese and Indigenous peoples alike. Indigenous peoples are the most oppressed. The Chinese were also oppressed with tactics like the Chinese Head Tax, and the Indigenous peoples came to our aid.

**CT:** 对您来说韧性这个词意味着什么？
**CT:** What does the term resilience mean to you?

**L:** 我们的先辈就是有韧性的，他们不怕困难，不怕艰苦。要交人头税那时候，修铁路的时候，死了那么多人，政府都不记录谁死了，连名字都不记，我们都忍耐下来，总有一天我们会有自己的权利。那时候我们开会就有个老太太，她的爸爸，爷爷，就是修太平洋铁路的。我是在唐人街关注组的组员。他们要拆唐人街，我们就说还我唐人街。
**L:** Those who came before us had resilience. They weren’t afraid of challenges and hardship. When they had to pay the Head Tax, when they were building the railroad, so many people died, and the government didn’t even write down the names of the deceased. They endured it, knowing that one day we would have rights. Resilience was when we met with the City of Vancouver, and we had an elder present whose father and grandfather worked on the railroad. I’m a member of Chinatown Concern Group. They want to tear down Chinatown, so we say give us back our Chinatown.

**CT:** 您对无形文化遗产这个词什么看法？或说，在唐人街有什么文化遗产是非物质文化遗产？
**CT:** What do you think of the term intangible heritage? What is intangible heritage in Chinatown?

**L:** 非物质文化指的就是指艺术方面的文化。唐人街的华人历史在温哥华没有第二个。唐人街的耍龙舞狮啊，热闹啊，挂红灯笼啊。现在唐人街灯笼挂的少了。都是他们那次来拆房子的关系。原来唐人街灯笼是一串儿一串儿的，从上到下，还有贴着春联，可好了，看起来就是过年的样子。没钱都像过年的样子。这就是我们加拿大华裔的文化。在中国，家家户户过年都会挂灯笼，也就无所谓了。但在唐人街就独一无二，所以好多人会来唐人街。我有朋友住在列治文，都会来这里逛街，买点家乡的东西。
**L:** Intangible heritage has to do with arts and culture. There’s no other Chinatown that carries Chinese diasporic history in Vancouver. There’s lion dancing here, and strings of red lanterns. It’s the atmosphere. But now there are fewer red lanterns in Chinatown. It’s related to when they came to tear down buildings. Chinatown used to have strings and strings of red lanterns, from top to bottom, and places would have spring couplets on their doors for Lunar New Year. Even if you didn’t have money or the resources, it felt like a celebration. That’s Chinese diasporic culture in Canada. Around Lunar New Year, every household in China would have lanterns, so it’s very common. But Chinatown is the only place that would have lanterns, so lots of people would come visit. Even my friends who live in Richmond would come to do their shopping and to buy things from back home.

**CT:** 每次逢年过节就特别看得出来华人文化。在新冠肺炎这段时间里来，您觉得您最大的压力和忧虑是什么？
**CT:** Chinese heritage and cultural practices are certainly more visible during celebrations. What has been your biggest worry throughout the pandemic?

**L:** 一开始唐人街的菜站关了，我觉得有点压力。我住的地方离唐人街菜站用不了五分钟就到了，可以吃的比较新鲜。什么油菜呀，菠菜呀，今天买了今天中午就吃了。可是那时候唐人街关闭了，就只好出门买好多菜放在那，不开门。后来隔了一个来月，日升就开放了。日升一开就好了，我带上口罩去买菜，反正我出门就带口罩。我不让我家先生出来。
**L:** At the beginning, I was worried because the grocery stores in Chinatown were closed. My apartment is less than five minutes’ walk from the grocery store, so we can eat fresh produce. Whether it’s yu choy or spinach, I could buy it and immediately cook it for lunch. But when Chinatown was shut down, I had to go to shops that were further to buy lots of produce at once and not go out as often. After a month, Sunrise Market reopened, so I would put on my mask and go shopping. Whenever I go out I wear a mask. I leave my husband at home.

**CT:** 您这么护着他。
**CT:** You must spoil him.

**L:** 他不愿带口罩，他说戴口罩憋气。我就让他在家里看电视。
**L:** He doesn’t like wearing a mask, he says he can’t breathe. So I leave him at home to watch TV.

**CT:** 这段时间里，您对您的生活和社会有什么感触吗？
**CT:** During this time, have you had any reflections on your life and society?

**L:** 政府有从食物银行供应食物。我吃面包还可以，喝牛奶不行。我是山东人，我喜欢吃干的东西，面包还可以吃。煎饼和豆腐是我家乡经常吃的食物。
**L:** The government has been distributing food through the food bank. I can eat the bread, but I can’t drink milk. I’m from Shandong, so I like foods that are dry. Bread is okay. Chinese pancakes and tofu are the usual fare in my hometown.

**CT:** 煎饼好吃啊！您自己做煎饼吗？
**CT:** Chinese pancakes are delicious! Do you know how to make them?

**L:** 我不会。我的妈妈可会做了。我会吃，不会做。
**L:** I can’t. But my mom made them really well. I know how to eat them, but not make them.

**CT:** 我也是会吃不会做。我就是吃货一个。您知道最近有很多关于黑人人权运动的游行抗议吗？
**CT:** Me too. I’m the designated rice bucket. Have you heard about the recent Black Lives Matter protests?

**L:** 知道。美国欺压黑人。我们都知道，都支持。现在们这些会讲英语的知识分子，但是一开始从中国来的华裔很多没有文化。因为中国以前是很穷的国家，所以华人先辈受尽的白人的歧视。他们歧视黑人，让黑人当奴隶，然后把他赶出来。华人在这里受歧视交人头税是最卑鄙的手段，连小孩也要交。我们就把他们欺负华人的事记到心里头。现在国家是人都要平等，这样歧视不讲理。美国歧视黑人就是这种手段，把他们赶出去，因为他们肤色不一样。我们反对因为黑人应该有权利的。联合国都给他们权利，有个人生活权利，为什么不给他们平等呢？我们都支持他。
**L:** I know. America oppresses Black people. We all know, and we all support Black folks. A lot of you young folks are intellectuals, but in the beginning, lots of Chinese settlers weren’t so educated. Because China was a country in poverty, the early Chinese settlers faced all kinds of discrimination from white people. They discriminated against Black people, made them slaves, then drove them out. Making the Chinese pay the Head Tax was despicable; even children weren’t spared. But we remember. Everybody should be equal, and discrimination is unreasonable. White American discrimination against Black people uses the same tactics, just because their skin colour is different. We oppose their racism because Black people have rights, too. The United Nations gives them their rights to live and to be, so why aren’t they being treated equally? We all support Black people.

**CT:** 您认为华人是怎么可以支持黑人人权活动呢？
**CT:** How do you think Chinese settlers can support Black Lives Matter?

**L:** 游行，到大街上喊口号，游行。打倒美国侵略者，还我人权。这两天是关注多，但是因为关闭了，我们没法去游行。在疫情之前我们都游行。
**L:** By protesting. By shouting slogans and protesting. We’d shout “down with American invaders, return my human rights.” There’s been lots of attention [on Black Lives Matter] these past few days, but because of quarantine, we can’t go out to protest. Before the pandemic, we’d all go to these protests.

**CT:** 唐人街虽然叫唐人街，但是这里的居民来自很多不同的文化背景。您对此是怎么看待的？您认为黑人人权运动和这些居民有什么关系？
**CT:** Even though Chinatown is called Chinatown, it’s always been a place for folks from all kinds of cultural backgrounds. What are your thoughts on this? How do you think Black Lives Matter is relevant to these different folks?

**L:** 我们是同样在这个多元文化环境里生活的。华人以前困难，现在已经翻了身了。加拿大政府已经道歉了，我们人权都有了。可是政府还没有跟黑人道歉。因为一个人和你面色不一样就欺负他是不对的。他也是人。是人就不能欺负人。我去的妇女中心就是在原住民社区。唐人街以前的时候，我们的前辈在这里修铁路。他们和原住民一起修的，一起被白人压迫。原住民和我们是好朋友。那时候帮助华人很多。他们自己也不富裕，但是他也帮助华人。在要交人头税的时候，有的人交不起，被白人逼着走。那时候原住居民就知道华人能干，聪明。他们知道如果华人被赶走了，就没有人帮他了。他们就拿出房子和吃的来给华人，让住在他家，吃在他家，再去赚钱。
**L:** We all live in the same multicultural environment. Early Chinese settlers faced difficulties, but they overcame. The Canadian government has apologized to the community, and we have human rights. But the government hasn’t apologized to Black people. It’s not right to bully someone just because their skin is a different colour than yours. They are people, too. If you’re a person, then you shouldn’t bully other people. The women’s centre I go to is in the Downtown Eastside. When the first generations of Chinese settlers were working on the railroad, they were working alongside Indigenous people, and were equally oppressed by white people. We’re good friends with Indigenous people. Back then, they helped the Chinese a lot. They didn’t have a lot of resources either, but they helped the Chinese. When the Chinese had to pay the Head Tax, those who couldn’t afford it were forced to leave. But the Indigenous peoples knew the Chinese were smart and hardworking. They knew that if the Chinese were chased out, there would be nobody to help them. They shared their homes and food with the Chinese, so they had a place to stay when they weren’t working.

**CT:** 现在的疫情为很多人造成了不便。您觉得大家能如何帮助您和其他的长辈们？
**CT:** The pandemic has caused a lot of inconvenience for lots of people. How can we help you and other elders?

{% contentImage "mrsLi_5of6.jpg", "" %}

**L:** 我们很感谢社区的这些年轻人。他们有帮助我们很多，给老人们做饭，送饭送上门，还打电话问候。社区里的年轻人可乐意帮助我们了，我觉得照顾的可好了。我可感谢这些年轻人了。他们会说，“奶奶，您需要什么就说，我们就是来帮助您的”。听到他们的问候也很欣慰。
**L:** We are very thankful for the youth of the community. They’ve helped us a lot by making meals for us, delivering them to our doors, and even phoning us to check in. These community youths are so willing to help us, and I feel so well taken care of. I’m so thankful for them. They would say, “Popo, if you need anything, we’re here to help you”. It warms my heart to simply receive these calls.

**CT:** 敬老也算是一种中华文化。您说这段时间有年轻人给您送菜吗？
**CT:** Respecting elders can be considered a kind of Chinese culture, too. Have these youths been delivering groceries to you during these times?

**L:** 这是世代同行会送的，我们这一个楼上都是他们送的。可好了，有卫生又干净的菜，可新鲜了。
**L:** They’re from the Yarrow Intergenerational Society. They deliver groceries to my entire building. It’s great, the produce is sanitary, clean, and very fresh.

**CT:** 您如果可以和这些义工们说话，您会说什么？
**CT:** What would you say to these volunteers if you had the chance?

**L:** 我会谢谢他们。我非常感谢这些年轻人，这些义工。每次给我们送的饭菜都很照顾我们的口味。送来的饭我们都吃好几天，味道都不变。我们非常感谢你们。我们这些日子的生活就靠你们关注。我们吃的也好，有菜有肉，什么都有。有一个王小姐，她经常打电话来。我们好几个人都很感谢她的关怀。
**L:** I would thank them. I’m very thankful for these youths and volunteers. Everytime they deliver meals and groceries, they’re always considerate of the kinds of foods we like. We can eat the meals they deliver for a few days, and it would still taste good. We’re so thankful for them. Our lives during these times are made better because of your attention and care. We eat well because of you, have produce and meats, and everything else. I’m always touched to receive check in phone calls. There’s Ms. Wong, who always phones many of us. We’re all so thankful for her care.

**CT:** 那我们问题都问完了。您有什么总结的话您想说吗？
**CT:** That’s the last of our questions. Do you have any summarizing comments you would like to make?

**L:** 现在有好多人没有房子住，是我应该关注的事情，是我们大家都应该关注的事情。
**L:** There are lots of people without housing. This is something I’m concerned about, and is something everyone should be concerned about.
