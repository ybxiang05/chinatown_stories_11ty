**CT:** What’s your relationship to Chinatown?

**P:** I’ve had a childhood connection with Chinatown, but I’m also reconnecting intentionally as an adult. I have grandparents who live just outside of Chinatown. When I visit them, we would often run errands, eat lunch, or have dim sum. I stopped going to Chinatown for a while when I moved to Burnaby, but I started getting more involved with the community again when I first noticed the effects of gentrification in Chinatown three or four years ago.

**CT:** How do you find yourself relating to Chinatown differently as a child versus as an adult?

**P:** I still look at Chinatown with a lot of wonder. As a kid, I thought of Chinatown as a super cool place with a lot of energy. I just wanted to eat and touch everything. I still have the same feelings, but my engagement now is more sophisticated and emotionally heavier. It feels like time is more of the essence. Now, I want to enjoy being in Chinatown, but also participate in shaping its future.

**CT:** Do you have a favourite memory of being in Chinatown?

**P:** My favourite childhood memory was running errands in Chinatown with my grandmother. Sometimes we would catch the night market. We would go up Pender Street, and I would want everything in the cool stalls. I remember begging my grandmother for this Hello Kitty fan I really wanted. I was so happy when she bought it for me. My Cantonese isn’t that great, but I remember feeling really connected with her at the moment. I recently took a Saturday Cantonese course at Wong‘s Benevolent Association. It was really fun to learn Cantonese, then go out and apply my knowledge while visiting the different shops around Chinatown. For example, we had a lesson on tea, then we went to a tea shop, introduced ourselves to the owner, and learned about Chinatown at the same time. That’s also a nice memory for me.

**CT:** How do you navigate being Chinese, Black, and queer while in Chinatown?

**P:** I’ve been through different phases of relating to and fitting into the Chinese and Chinatown communities that I belong to. As a child, barriers and expectations were different. Because I was always with my grandparents, I felt very integrated. As I got older and into my teens, I faced a lot of resistance, where people would tell me I’m not really Chinese because I’m not Chinese-passing. I felt a lot of disconnect with the neighbourhood, with the Cantonese language, and with being Chinese Canadian in general. Sometimes I still feel alienated in these spaces, but now I feel like I’m a bit more welcomed in.

**CT:** For me, there’s always the juxtaposition of not having the language even though I look like I should fit in those spaces, or look like I should feel the same connection to others who do have the language. It’s a weird feeling to navigate.

**P:** Totally. I feel like I was heavily influenced by Cantonese culture. I was surrounded by the language at home, and I do a lot of things that are “Chinese”, but I’m missing language fluency and the obvious visual of being Chinese-passing. Some of my East Asian friends who don’t have as much connection to Chinatown as I do will have an easier time integrating into the community and be accepted immediately just because they look the part. I’m not afforded that immediate acceptance all the time. It’s an interesting space to navigate.

**CT:** Why is it important for people of colour to be represented in the media?

**P:** My relationship with visibility, especially in Vancouver, is being hyper-visible while being invisible at the same time. We’ve all seen that one Disney film that’s supposedly made for everybody, but feels so generic and doesn’t resonate with anybody.

## It’s extremely important to have our world reflected in the media we consume, because the more specific a story is, the more relatable it becomes. That’s the role of storytelling, to learn about each other, to expand our perspectives, and to transport ourselves outside of our own world.

I want us to keep expanding and pushing for other narratives to be at the forefront of things. We don’t lose anything by hearing about someone else’s lived experience. You can have the same story of a girl falling in love, but with different cultural variants and implications, it becomes a different story. We’re all telling the same story in slightly different ways. I think it’s exciting, and I want to see more different things!

**CT:** Are there ways you see your art, or art in general as a form of resilience?

**P:** First of all, being an artist is already something that North American society doesn’t support. I’m always told I’m going to be a starving artist, or that I’m not going to be very successful, so being an artist is already a form of resilience. Secondly, being a Black woman in this city where perspectives like mine have been excluded for so long is something that’s doubly resilient. Resilience is existing and valuing my perspective, and trying to tell my stories. It’s really easy to not want to share your perspective because you don’t think it’ll be heard. Sometimes I think about how people are going to relate to my work, but I’ve learned that there’s space for everybody’s story, and that my story is part of the collective story. I’ve been trying to internalize that more, and make sure I end up saying what I want to say when I create art. It’s taken me some time to get to this place. People benefit from hearing my experiences in the same way I benefit from hearing their lived experiences, too.

**CT:** Is there a particular reason why you like the children’s genre?

**P:** I think it’s an often underestimated category because people forget how smart kids are. I think it’s crucial to introduce them to all sorts of perspectives, especially now, when we’re having more conversations around representation in the media. I’m biased because I love cartoons, but kids’ stories can be thought-provoking, even for adults. There’s just so much that can be imagined and explored within the children’s genre.

**CT:** Do you find it challenging to work with larger studios for shows that have an all-white or all heteronormative cast where it might be very
different from your lived experiences?

**P:** A lot of the shows I worked on earlier in my career would have a single Black character who looks and acts exactly like the white characters but with tanned skin, and none of it resonated with me. It’s refreshing when there’s more than one Black person on the team. I try to bring as much of myself as I can to projects. I like storyboarding because it’s in the earlier stages of animation, and I get to work closely with the director and the script. This way it’s easier to influence decisions on how characters might speak or act. It really does matter, because authenticity in representation will come through, depending on who you hire for a project. It’s taken me a while, but now I’m in a position where the people I work with value my input and collaboration. When I’m drawing a frame, I, for example, purposefully make the girl and non-binary characters exit the screen first, so it’s not always the boys leading a group out. Children pick up on the smallest things, so I make sure I try to do that whenever I can.

**CT:** How did you get to this point where you’re able to influence these decisions?

**P:** In 2019, which feels like so long ago, I wanted to quit the animation industry. I felt as if I were just a pair of drawing hands, hired to carry out the director’s vision, even though I wanted to get into animation so I can provide creative input for story aspects. I felt like I wasn’t being heard. It shouldn’t be a privilege to bring your whole self to a project. That’s when I started exploring comics, where I could do my own storytelling. In 2019, one of the co-directors of Hair Love ended up reading my autobiographical comic called Tension, and he reached out to me to see if I was free.

<!-- <img src="pearlLow_3of5"/> -->

Hair Love was my foot in the door to the LA industry. That was my first experience working on a project that was telling a story I cared about, and had characters that look like me. From that point on, I worked towards making connections in the LA animation industry. I’m now working with more Black creatives than I have ever worked with in my entire life, and it’s refreshing because in these spaces, I can exercise my perspective much more than before. I had to metaphorically leave Vancouver to find what was good for me.

**CT:** What are your thoughts on the connection between art and gentrification?

**P:** Beautification is such a weird thing. Who is it for, and who is it done by? I want people to be able to see Indigenous street art, and I don’t want to be centering white perspectives in that conversation. Art is not just white. Art is for everybody. It is sad to see gentrification leaning into “beautifying” a neighbourhood, and to see folks associate whiteness with street art, but that pattern exists. It’s also a question of visibility. A lot of murals seem to pop up magically, but you don’t get to see who made it. You don’t get to see the process, and the only person who’s visibly attached to the artwork is the white shop owner on whose wall the mural is painted. I just painted my mural on Davie Street and I left. It’s not a community I belong to, nor do I personally hang out there. It’s queer, but it’s also super white. I don’t like the idea of street art being there because white people wanted it there.

**CT:** Are there ways in which your art intersects with Chinatown, or is culturally specific?

**P:** I haven’t been doing too many pieces surrounding Chinatown, but I do try to use my platform as much as I can to loop the community in. I’ve done a few projects with Chinatown Today such as illustrating their Chinese Baked Goods Guide and Hua Foundation, creating illustrations for their Chinese Dried Goods Guide. The book Chinatown Pretty just came out. I love it, and I very happily posted about it on social media. I also just talk a lot about poh pohs (grandmas) on Twitter, and I draw a lot of comics with my grandma in them. I talk a lot about my experience with her and the language that binds us, which ends up looping in the Chinatown experience. I hope my artwork makes people circle back around to the community again, as a reminder that we’re still here.

**CT:** What do you think Chinatown means now to folks who are not ethnically Chinese?

**P:** I always feel salty about how white supremacists created Chinatown to prevent Chinese people from moving elsewhere in the city, but now Chinese seniors are being kicked out of this area that was supposedly created for us because they didn’t want us around. I think businesses that are in Chinatown but whose services and products don’t cater to Chinatown communities need to reexamine the way they occupy the space and engage with the community. I’m also thinking about people who live in Chinatown, but who don’t do their shopping in Chinatown. A community is an ecosystem, and you should participate in it and want to help it grow. If these conversations aren’t being had, then you’re part of the problem. You shouldn’t occupy a space if you don’t care about the community there. Gentrification is modern colonization. It’s displacing people by forcefully making them leave because they can no longer afford to live in an area. Food security is one of the first things that makes a community thrive, and so many grocery stores have closed down in Chinatown. It’s important to recognize that your actions have an effect on the community. You may not know about these effects, but it’s important to be self-aware and to learn about your own impact. This is a huge part of allyship, and allyship is hard work for the rest of your days.

**CT:** What do you think are some ways people can support these communities?

**P:** For me, a huge part is financial support, especially from businesses that aren’t native to Chinatown. It would be cool if restaurants in Chinatown could host lunch for seniors, make lunch boxes, or offer free coffee or tea with a bun to those who have been in these communities for a long time as a way of giving back. I feel like Vancouver has an interesting struggle with cultivating community, where we tend to stay in our cultural enclaves. People will say Vancouver is multicultural, but I don’t feel like people individually mingle outside of their own respective communities. What are these elders going to do? They don’t have the language, they don’t have the same resources as other folks who also occupy Chinatown. That’s a gap that needs to be bridged. I just want white people to try. It might be exhausting to you at first because the work is new, but it pushes you to exercise empathy in a way you’ve never had to before. That’s what growth is.

**CT:** It’s one of those things where if it’s easy, you’re probably not doing enough. I find that even as an East Asian person, I constantly need to check my privilege, especially in Chinatown. When we think of Chinatown as a community, it’s so much more intersectional than what we make it out to be. What are your thoughts on the current relationship between Chinatown and Hogan’s Alley, and the difficulties of facilitating conversations between different communities?

**P:** It’s a conversation that we need to have in different ways. There tends to be a narrative where if one community can pull themselves up by the bootstraps, other communities should be able to do the same. But not every community experiences the same form of oppression, which means they don’t benefit from the same form of help. I think a lot of inter-community support can be built around one community filling space where the other lacks, but this support should be built around asking people from the community what they need without assuming you know what it is. It’s hard to navigate. It’s about cultivating visibility and spaces where we could feature different voices or different communities coming together.

**CT:** The Black Lives Matter movement gained huge momentum during the past few months, and it’s heartening to finally see this amplification of Black voices. In what ways has the Black Lives Matter movement impacted your daily life?

**P:** I’ve actually had a really fruitful 2020. I feel like every Black person and their mom is being contacted by employers who are scrambling to hire Black talent. I hope people take advantage of this and see that our foundation has never been stable, and that we need to rebuild a new one from scratch. I feel like we need to actually start to dismantle the system this time, instead of just slapping on band-aid solutions. Everybody, but especially white people, need to realize that it takes a lifetime of unpacking and relearning to recreate a foundation. It takes intentionally building bridges to include Black folks to close that large gap between us and what everyone else has access to. It’s weird to be both excited about new opportunities and to be heartbroken all the time because we’re faced with Black death and Black tragedy. It’s an emotional rollercoaster ride that I’m on, and a lot of other Black folks are on, too. Your Black friend is trying to be okay through all of this. We’re trying to go to work as if it’s normal, we’re trying to find joy in these moments. We’re doing a lot of stuff, while also trying to vocalize what we’ve been saying all along, over and over again, to the rest of the world. It’s been a fruitful time for me, but in a time of turmoil.

**CT:** I think that really speaks to your ideas that it’s important to have that sense of joy. Being a person of colour means you have your 9 to 5 job, but you also have your 24/7 job of unpaid emotional labour. You spoke about how companies are scrambling to hire Black talent. Do you have thoughts on how to further remove these barriers?

**P:** It’s the responsibility of white people in positions of power to hire people of colour in positions of power alongside themselves, because you need to have representation at all levels, including the very top. I’ve heard white people say in meetings that they don’t want to hire people of colour for the sake of tokenization, but it’s only tokenizing if you’re hiring them for the sake of them being people of colour. An excuse I hear a lot in Vancouver is that it’s hard to find Black applicants. If your intention is truly to hire Black folks, the solution is to search for them in unconventional ways. You need to think outside the box. You never know what you’ll find on Twitter. There are so many avenues through which you can find talent, but you have to put in the effort, and you have to reach for these people. Sometimes white decision makers will say people of colour “don’t have the right qualifications”, but these qualifications cost so much money, and the schools that offer these qualifications aren’t looking to accept people of colour to begin with. Just because someone didn’t take a specific course doesn’t mean they don’t have equivalent experiences, or that they have any less potential in doing a job well. Mentorship is really important, too. It’s about investing in people of colour and bridging the gap. I’ve heard people say that investing in people of colour is an unfair advantage, but they don’t realize it’s actually because society has given white people the unfair advantage. It only seems unfair and like a lot of work because that’s the difference between what you’ve been given versus what we’ve been given.

**CT:** What has been your biggest fear throughout the pandemic, and what do you do to get through it?

**P:** Loss of connection was a huge fear of mine. Even though I’m really close with my grandparents, they’re elderly, and I didn’t want to expose them to the virus. One thing I thought about a lot during the pandemic is how life seems so short, and you might as well do something that makes you happy, just because you never know what’s going to come at you within a week. During these times, everything changes by the day. Now I’m more intentional about what I take into my day, who I interact with, and just what I feed into my life experience. That’s how I’ve been coping.

**CT:** What does resilience mean to you?

**P:** My identity has a lot of intersections, and I feel like my entire existence is resilience. I’m Black, I’m queer, I’m an artist, and resilience to me means being my most authentic self. Resilience is creating and maintaining space in the face of white supremacy, which can look different for every community, because different communities need different support. It’s also about helping others hold space for themselves. We exist and move through the world in different capacities, and I think that’s important to recognize when talking about resilience.

<!-- <img src="pearlLow_4of5"/> -->

**CT:** You talked about resilience as existing and working through white supremacy and colonial practices. What does that look like in your daily practice?

**P:** I think my practice has more firmly centred Black joy, especially in these times, catalyzed by the George Floyd incident. We’re faced with a lot of Black suffering. It’s part of the conversation, but it’s not the only part of the conversation. A part of resilience that needs to be mentioned is joy, because the function of racism is to not allow racialized folks to be happy and live our lives. Racism creates distractions to bring you down, so it’s very important to make sure you still find moments of joy. That’s what I try to do in my practice and in my storytelling.

## I want to remind folks how joyful our communities are, whether it’s Black communities, or Asian communities. We’re not just marginalized folks who are suffering. We have happy moments, too, and we have things to celebrate.
