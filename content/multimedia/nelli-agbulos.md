anak, remember you are a welcome guest in Chinatown
one of many diasporic beloveds existing between two worlds
yearning for places to call home
these sidewalks are different from other Chinatowns you have visited
but each Chinatown has embraced strangers on different parts of their journey
(I was one of them)
I hope one day you realize that our struggles have always been connected
our fight for land, people’s rights,
the rights of migrants,
the livelihood of Black and Indigenous peoples,
genuine liberation for the people in our homeland(s),
and preservation of our culture and language
it’s not always clear where the lines are drawn
and where people stand on issues
but sometimes, there’s comfort in knowing
there are others who understand the struggle
being torn between countries or healing from the violence they’ve left behind
we’ve lost buildings nearby that once housed Filipino organizations
groups crumbled from the pressure of individual desires
some people left and found community elsewhere
others lost hope but tried again
few stayed to teach us lessons from the past
a handful said that community organizing didn’t matter
and building relationships during the corona virus was impossible
but we always came back to Chinatown
to dream, plan, and eat siopao
rest is restorative
organizing is a struggle
laughter is essential
adapting to change is necessary
and eating at New Town is a beloved tradition
we live to fight another day
because the struggle in the Philippines crosses borders and oceans
we continue meeting in Chinatown because
this is the ground where I found other Filipinos and allies
who made me feel less alone
