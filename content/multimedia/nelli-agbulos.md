anak, remember you are a welcome guest in Chinatown <br>
one of many diasporic beloveds existing between two worlds<br>
yearning for places to call home<br>

these sidewalks are different from other Chinatowns you have visited<br>
but each Chinatown has embraced strangers on different parts of their journey<br>
(I was one of them)<br>

I hope one day you realize that our struggles have always been connected<br>
our fight for land, people’s rights,<br>
the rights of migrants,<br>
the livelihood of Black and Indigenous peoples,<br>
genuine liberation for the people in our homeland(s),<br>
and preservation of our culture and language<br>

it’s not always clear where the lines are drawn<br>
and where people stand on issues<br>
but sometimes, there’s comfort in knowing<br>
there are others who understand the struggle<br>
being torn between countries or healing from the violence they’ve left behind<br>

we’ve lost buildings nearby that once housed Filipino organizations<br>
groups crumbled from the pressure of individual desires<br>
some people left and found community elsewhere<br>
others lost hope but tried again<br>
few stayed to teach us lessons from the past<br>
a handful said that community organizing didn’t matter<br>
and building relationships during the corona virus was impossible<br>
but we always came back to Chinatown<br>
to dream, plan, and eat siopao<br>

rest is restorative<br>
organizing is a struggle<br>
laughter is essential<br>
adapting to change is necessary<br>
and eating at New Town is a beloved tradition<br>

we live to fight another day<br>
because the struggle in the Philippines crosses borders and oceans<br>
we continue meeting in Chinatown because<br>
this is the ground where I found other Filipinos and allies<br>
who made me feel less alone<br>
