title: Goldstone Stories
order: 10
blurb: "In March 2020, Goldstone Restaurant closed its doors and was put up for sale due to the pandemic. With a long list of offerings that span both sides of a legal-sized menu in multiple columns of fine print, Goldstone had been a refuge for nostalgia, community organizing, and affordable, delicious food. Every good story needs a good setting, and in losing Goldstone, we have lost another setting in which Chinatown stories are made. To remember Goldstone, we asked members of the community to share their own stories and memories made here, as well as their favourite items from the menu. To nobody’s surprise, the famous Goldstone egg tarts were a crowd favourite (it was our favourite, too)."

### Juliane Siu

“When I was a little girl, Goldstone was mine and my Yeh Yeh’s go-to restaurant almost every time after we visited the doctor when I was sick. The food and the white noise from the clinking of silverware and chatter were so comforting that it made me forget I was feeling miserable, if only for a short while .”

**Favourite item:** Toasted ham and egg sandwich and fries combo with Hong Kong style tea with condensed milk ^\_^

### Darren and Anastasia

“A big part of why we moved to live in Chinatown was to be close to Goldstone. When we tried our first bite of baked pork chop on rice, we felt such an unspeakable sense of nostalgia and satisfaction. We loved coming for breakfast on the weekends, seeing the hustle and bustle families, couples, and our favourite grandpas and grandmas. We will miss the warm, wafting aroma of milk tea, and we are profoundly thankful for the comforting community Goldstone allowed us to experience.”

### Lawrence Szeto

“I love Goldstone and will always remember my parents taking me and my siblings there when we were young. It’s sad to see this historic part of Chinatown close. It has been there for generations, and I would have liked to continue the tradition with my children. I will always remember going to Goldstone on my wedding day and ordering 10 chicken sandwiches to go.”

**Favourite item:** Chicken sandwich

### Jenny Szeto

“My mom worked as a waitress at Goldstone when she first immigrated to Canada. One of my fondest childhood memories was visiting her at the restaurant and enjoying a pineapple bun, red bean ice with ice cream, and spaghetti.”

**Favourite item:** Pineapple bun

### Therise Wen Li Lee

“When I started working downtown last year, my dad and I made it a weekly routine to visit Goldstone for breakfast. It was such a delight to take pause before a busy day or week ahead, and simply enjoy some bo lo baos, fish congee, and freshly made egg tarts. I loved watching other customers as they settled into the comfort of a simple breakfast with a newspaper, or groups of old friends as they gathered and chatted into the mid-morning sun. Goldstone was truly a gem in the heart of Chinatown. It was a privilege to share a slow meal with my Father and reminisce over a simple bowl of fish congee, made to perfection.”

### Vedrana

“I went for the first time in the spring of 2015 with two friends from university who introduced me to egg tarts, Hong Kong-style French toast, and Hong Kong-style milk tea/coffee. Since then, I’ve gone back a few times with friends for the consistently great service and food. Thank you for the great memories, food, and service over the years.”

**Favourite item:** Hong Kong style French toast

### Vivian Wong

“There weren’t a lot of Chinese restaurants or places back in the 90’s. My family would go grocery shopping in Chinatown, and we would swing by Goldstone to pick up baked goods to bring home. When we were feeling fancy, we would dine in at the restaurant. I had many fond memories here, and in Chinatown in general. Goldstone had a sense of community, and it felt like home.”

**Favourite item:** Pineapple bun

### Russell

“I would meet up with friends for breakfast before work at Goldstone, and I’d often be early. Sitting alone in a booth, watching people stream in and out of the door under the golden morning light was really something. When I would order club sandwiches for lunch, I would walk down to the restaurant, but run back with my order so the bread (which we’d ask for extra toasted) would stay crispy. I moved to Victoria last year for law school. Whenever I was able to come back to Vancouver, Goldstone was usually my last stop before heading to the ferry, where I’d grab the best egg tarts in Vancouver and a few pineapple buns for breakfast. Even a day or two old, these baked goods have no comparison.“

**Favourite item:** Baked Pork Chop on Rice OR “A” Breakfast w/ luncheon meat and sub bread for Bo Lo Jau

### Jasper Lam

“My favourite Goldstone memory was when I met my friends Rachel and Beatrix at the Zine Fair. We visited Ho Tam at his studio/shop, went to Centre A, had a rice roll snack from Sun Fresh, and then had another snack at Goldstone before going for dinner at Salmon and Bannock. It was a special moment for me to be together and socializing with a group of Chinese Canadians and individuals from Hong Kong all with varying levels of fluency in Cantonese.”

**Favourite item:** Pineapple bun

## Miniature

The last place we had a conversation was at Goldstone Bakery and Restaurant. I hadn’t seen you in almost two years. As usual I ordered baked pork chop on rice. It reminded me of the warmth of friendship. We want things to last forever. Like Forever, Chinatown. That’s why Frank Wong made those miniatures. What would a miniature of Goldstone look like? There’d be so much glue on the table from getting all the booths just right. Hands and eyes would ache measuring from memory, from desire.

If it was important enough to eat at Goldstone, it was important.

There’d be the big, clattering table by the window where the planners and the veterans and association members sat after the 105 Keefer hearings. Then there’d be the quiet table behind the cash counter. Where the queers hung out. Every time we went it was special. You could even order the devil. It’d always be coffee, Ovaltine, or Horlicks for me. The finishing touch: a moon-face clock as majestic as the plate of clam and mushroom chowder.

Can you read the menu with a magnifying glass?
Can you paint quiet and loud with little brushes?

I’d include a little lactaid bottle. Someone always brought one.

“Oh shoot I forgot to bring cash.”
“Let me cover for you this time.”
