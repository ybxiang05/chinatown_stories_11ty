Recently I found out that Gold Stone Bakery had closed from my friend whose mother was a cook there. Upon hearing this, I felt gutted at the loss of this diner, like a part of my childhood had died. While I wasn’t a regular there, there was still an attachment to Gold Stone as my mom brought me there as a child. Not only was this the demise of a piece of nostalgia, but it revealed to me the impending demise of an entire generation and community of Chinese immigrants.

I began trying to imagine a Vancouver without sassy auntie waitresses, or crass uncle butchers. My imagination then extended to picturing the city without wandering Asian grannies wearing sun hats, layered in colourful prints of florals and checks, effortlessly mixing different textures and eras together. And who could forget the can collecting elders, reminiscent of their cardboard collecting counterparts in Hong Kong.

These are all familiar characters for those who grew up in East Vancouver. Even though we all live in the same city, different sides of the same cloth are often dismissive of each other.

I must confess to a self-loathing time in my teens when I had what I would call a more traditionally Canadian outlook. A time when I had a disparaging attitude towards these immigrants who I did not register as peers of my own family.

Since then, I have learned a lot about myself and about the history of Chinese immigrants in Vancouver, trying to understand the adversities that they and other immigrants alike had and still have to face. I would compare that to my own experiences growing up Asian in a Western society. Today I see others and myself much differently than I did before. When I see an immigrant or foreigner now, I can only imagine the inspiring tales they could tell.

Earlier this year, another favourite Shanghainese restaurant of mine in East Van had closed, Ning Tu. My family had been dining there since I was a child, and I only have fond memories of the food and experiences had there. I assume that they closed because of retirement, as the restaurant appeared to be doing quite well for themselves in recent years prior to their closing. I imagine the staff were at an age where it just did not make sense to renew their lease, that they did not have successors to the business, and so it was a suitable time for retirement.

I am unsure about the financial situation at Gold Stone, but it should not be so surprising to see these businesses closing, regardless of COVID-19. As the owners and staff grow old, without their children (who have likely ventured on to more notable careers) to carry on their businesses – not to mention the depleting numbers of their primary clientele, closing is imminent for these community-hub-like restaurants.

I asked my friend how her mom felt about the restaurant closing and she replied saying that her mother is feeling alright about it, and overall, not all that concerned. It appeared that her mom seemed nonchalant about it, almost blasé, but I still imagined glimmers of gloom derived from my own romanticized nostalgia of the diner. I idealized her mom as a hardworking, simple, yet thankful, humble immigrant mother. Rather than being upset about losing her job, perhaps she even feels emancipated from it.

Since knowing about the closure of Gold Stone, I told a friend from Hong Kong about it and he was surprisingly disheartened by this. I asked why he felt this way, since I figured diners like Gold Stone were a dime a dozen back in Hong Kong. He then explained to me, just like the iconic fluorescent lights in Hong Kong, vintage diners were also dwindling. Slowly but surely, the anachronistic is changing and being replaced.

As I’m getting older myself, I am witnessing the changes in my surroundings pass before me. It seems like every year, a favourite restaurant of mine closes, replaced by new modern cafés, condos, or high-rises. I’m really beginning to understand my elders more and more, like when my grandma says something doesn’t taste the same or as good as when she had it decades ago. Soon enough, if not already, that will be me and my generation reminiscing about the past.

I have come to understand that this is a fact of life, change and loss. In our day to day, we often take for granted what is actually very unique, such as a simple restaurant. In my teens, I hated going to these Hong Kong style diners. What I had perceived as dowdy and second-class in a pejorative way is now something I see with reverence and warmth. Something that is actually extremely special and sentimental, something I feel that anyone would be lucky to really experience and to be immersed in its mundanity.

Today, whenever I go to these diners, especially the older ones that are more out-of-date, I really cherish the experience of going, from the now-retro décor, to the charismatic staff, and of course the food, unpretentious yet noble. It’s saddening, the thought of never tasting something again, like to never see or be with a loved one again. But like death, it is all rather inevitable. What isn’t passed on, and consciously preserved will be lost. I wish the things, places and people we love can stay forever, but change and loss is ineludible. What may feel bitter to accept now, will become sweeter to reminisce later. Like our elders have, this is a reality we must all face.
