The fourth panel is on the bottom left hand corner of the page. The text reads of survival on a green sky background. below the sky is the backs of a crowd of people, holding signs that imply the crowd is at a demonstration. Most of the crowd is in grey or brown, but three prominent figures are in a darker brown and black. The one on the most left is holding a beige sign that reads BLM, and the person on the right is holding a grey sign above their head that reads LAND BACK.

The fifth panel is on the bottom right hand corner of the page. It reads become mundane on a purple background. The foreground has a blue weekly pill-box, left open on Monday.
