It was in Vancouver’s Chinatown where I heard “go back to where you came from” for the first time.

The spirit of Chinatown derives from shared histories and experiences, and the resilience of the Chinatown space comes from the people. It is less of an active resilience, and more an adaptive one of constant transformation.

I come from Regina, Saskatchewan, where I was born and raised in a small prairie city with an even smaller Chinese community. I found myself moving back and forth from the prairies to Vancouver, both places being home, and both places evoking that sense of Chinatown spirit.

Being raised by my Grandmother in a rural prairie town, I always felt connected to her culture and language. She wore a matching silk blouse and pants everyday, often with secret pockets sewn in to hide money or valuables. To understand my Grandmother was to understand the balance of love and tragedy. She would tell me stories about living in the village in China. Sometimes she told these stories to make me laugh; other times, the stories seemed like tragic moments shared to let the universe know that those moments still hurt.

With my Grandmother gone, I felt the culture, language, and memories fading, but entering Vancouver’s Chinatown was like walking into her arms, a warm hug to let me know she was still there. Every aspect of Chinatown allowed me to think of her: the Tai Chi in the park, grocers full of fresh fruit that she would cut for me, and the loud voices of gunggungs and popos as they rushed to dim sum or to catch their next bus. When I would hear Hoisanese elders chatting in the streets, I would always look around, as though I might somehow see my Grandmother appear. No matter how alone I would feel, I would be comforted in this enclave built from dislocation. Every stranger in Chinatown seems like someone I know.

To exist in Chinatown is to survive where the hustle is contingent on the uncontrollable. The past, present, and future occur simultaneously here. It’s a space born of displacement, and it never seems at rest.

The pandemic is another element of this survival. I think of the elders, hiding in their single rooms, alone. Unable to gather in the streets, their safety is dependent on their isolation. As I long to walk the streets, I sit in my house on the prairies and write letters to the elders in Chinatown, hoping my spirit can lift theirs during isolation. From far away, I feel their loneliness, much like I felt my grandmother’s.

Returning to Chinatown was my way of touching my Grandmother’s spirit. The longer I am away from these streets, the more I feel her spirit fade.
