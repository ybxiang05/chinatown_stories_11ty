the color is raw titanium
like fresh suman wrapped in banana leaves and sugar-coated pastillas hugged in crinkled paper chucked back and chugged with bear brand milk, diaspora baby with a sweet tooth

the color is yellow oxide
like sepia-toned afternoons in Binondo and fluorescent-lit nightmarkets flickering with murmurs and sweaty bodies, diaspora babyâ€™s first steps

cadmium red goji berries floating in ginseng-flavored soup and light brown tea leaf eggs in translucent plastic bags, diaspora baby learns color theory

a lost-and-found baby (b)raised in third-culture stew, cooked down to westernized adolescent with insecurities about identity and nutty undertones

baby looks for clos-
ure in incomplete family trees and five spice powder sprinkled into popcorn chicken marinades and braised pork rice, birthed from generic dreams and childhood dishes during outbreak March to lockdown April and please-stay-home May

baby is foreign to native tongue, finds solace in feasts, soothe palate with siu-mai in bamboo steamers and see silver tins carrying chicken feet once exotic turned delicacy, coat my tongue with salt from the oceans we crossed, finding new homes

Di-as-po-ra baby
is home
