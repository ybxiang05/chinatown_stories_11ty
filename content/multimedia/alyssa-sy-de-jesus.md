Porcelain<br>
was desired for its resiliency<br>
& the ability to paint attractive images<br>
upon its surface<br>

“White gold”<br>
it was called<br>
in eighteenth-century Europe<br>

“Porcelain”<br>
my flesh is called<br>
in this-century North America<br>

my mother was once presented<br>
with the following unsolicited theory:<br>
“white women are strong on the outside but weak on the inside<br>
Asian women are weak on the outside but strong on the inside”<br>

this bullshit (in a china shop)<br>
we sit through and endure<br>

Why<br>
does it have to be about marking<br>
which parts of us<br>
are prone to breaking?<br>

And<br>
what does it have to do<br>
with surface—<br>
considering china<br>
is made from the kilned<br>
ground-up<br>
bones<br>
of dead animals<br>
