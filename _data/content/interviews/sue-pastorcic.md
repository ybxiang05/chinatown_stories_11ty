**CT:** Can you tell us about your relationship with Chinatown and how you came to work here?

**S:** I’ve been working with Embers Eastside Works since it came into our community roughly 3 year ago. I went to an employment office to get support, and soon after started on the Chinatown Community Stewardship Program.

**CT:** Do you have a favourite memory of being in Chinatown?

**S:** I remember attending the Chinatown parade about 2 years ago. I also remember the fabulous markets in the summer. It was nice because it felt like Chinatown opened up wide. Back in the 70s, my parents would bring me down to Chinatown and we’d buy our food here.

**CT:** How has Chinatown changed between the 70s and now?

**S:** There’s been a lot of changes, especially in the last eight or nine months. It wasn’t perfect before, but I feel that things have gotten somewhat worse.

**CT:** What are some of these changes in the last eight or nine months?

**S:** I work with businesses in Chinatown, so I have a connection with a lot of the storefronts. I check in with them to make sure they’re safe, see how the owners are feeling, and what our program can do better to support them. Some people have said that they are afraid. I’ve noticed a lot of Chinatown stores are locked up, closing their doors, or have given up. I don’t speak Chinese, but we give each other a thumbs up or thumbs down to see how things are going. A lot of these businesses need money to support their families, but they are getting their windows broken in. A lot of them are scared to talk to strangers or are hesitant to report problems. Last week early in the morning, I saw a woman trying to keep a door closed as three gentlemen were trying to force their way in. I spoke with the men and asked them to remove themselves. I had to deal with some language that wasn’t pleasant but they moved along. The lady was too scared to even come out to speak with me, but eventually she let me know how scared she was and thanked me.

**CT:** Thank you so much for sharing and stepping in at that moment. Could you tell us what resilience means to you?

**S:** We need to make Chinatown safer somehow, but it’s a big problem, and I don’t know how we can do it. One way I see things getting better is through handling drug addiction better. I’ve been horrified to hear about the racism towards Chinese people because of the idea that they brought COVID-19 to Canada. But you can’t blame people for that. Nobody should get hurt or experience violence over racism, but unfortunately it is happening. Back in the 70’s, Chinatown was amazing. It was safe and people were friendly, but now people are always hesitant. Most of the people I talk to are elderly. But I think just smiling at each other or giving a thumbs up makes a big difference.

**CT:** My grandparents would take me down here in the 90s, and even compared to then, I’ve seen so much change.

**S:** Oh yeah! My mom and dad would bring me down and buy me those beautiful lamps that changed colours and had the strings coming down. As a kid I used to love that. I still do, but these days they’re hard to find, and a lot of places are closed.

**CT:** Apart from closures, are there ways you’ve seen or experienced the effects of COVID-19 in Chinatown?

**S:** It’s changed a lot of things for people. I believe in universal basic income. When people can get some money, they are happy because they are able to live. I think everybody has the right to a life where they have a bit of extra money to do things. When the federal government introduced CERB, everyone applied. But CERB was only for six months, and now it’s run out for a lot of people. In my observations, this has led to an increase in break-ins and crime. I used to be a part of this community at one point but now it feels like it’s been taken over and it’s sad. I blame the system because we deserve to be treated like people and not numbers. I’m glad I have Eastside Works. The people here are amazing, they support each and every one one of us stewards. I was able to grow through this program. Without Eastside Works I would have been something different. I know about the realities of the Downtown Eastside, because I lived it. I’m drug free. I’m alcohol free. I’m way beyond who I thought I was. In my lifetime, I went through a lot of challenges, and I wasn’t able to have a real job per se. When Eastside Works opened, it was my opportunity to get better, to get healthier, and to get working. I’ve accomplished that because of Eastside Works. This is my family here.

**CT:** It’s amazing to hear your journey in such. Could you tell us more about the Chinatown Stewardship Program and your time with them?

**S:** We aren’t police but we do pretty good work. There’s two shifts, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. We check in on storefronts, do garbage pick up, needle pick up, and just try to save lives. We carry Narcan and try to be well equipped to do our part to keep people safe. Even though we specifically look out for the storefronts in Chinatown, we try to look out for everyone. A couple of weeks ago my coworker and I had to deal with a pretty bad scene outside of the office here. There was a girl and we had to call the paramedics to save her, we had to explain that the poor girl had lice from head to toe. And they said that they would come when they could, a couple hours. We couldn’t wait a couple hours. This girl was going to die. So I had to run to the medical centre and grab the nurses to get her a crash cart. Finally a doctor got on the phone with the paramedics and told them that they need to come now. As soon as they came they were shocked with the situation and weren’t very sympathetic. I knew that the girl had experienced sexual violence and they basically didn’t treat her as a person. I had to take a few days off work after to think about these things.

## I’ve come a long way in three years, and Eastside Works is and will always be my home.

**CT:** That’s so good to hear. I think your journey in itself is a story of resilience and it goes to show that there are many people here who come from difficult situations but given the chance and opportunities, you can turn your life around.

**S:** People definitely can turn their lives around. But unfortunately, support is hard to come by. I was lucky to be one of the fortunate ones to get to know the people here at Eastside Works. Just being here makes me so happy to be alive and have people I can trust. The work has its challenges, but I’m a survivor. They’ve done so much for me.

**CT:** What would you say is the most challenging part about your work that people wouldn’t know?

**S:** We need more outreach people. We have some but not quite enough. Right now everyone is in a bad place, mostly due to income. The government is risking our lives when they don’t help us.

**CT:** Are there potential solutions or ways people can help the communities down here?

**S:** I believe we need more places like Eastside Works. With COVID-19, it’s so hard to meet and help people. We don’t have support services and because they weren’t already in place, it’s even harder to build them because of COVID-19. There are people who started working at the same time or before me, and they are still here. It’s sad to see that people can’t come here anymore, or have coffee, or keep warm when the winter comes. Where are these people going to go now? Last year we had a Christmas party for the whole community. It was beautiful. We were all accepted. There was hot chocolate and cookies. This year that’s not going to happen. I think this year we will see an increase in violence and I worry about the survival rates.

**CT:** What would you want people, from outside of Chinatown and the Downtown Eastside, to know about the communities you work with?

**S:** My mom and my kids are scared I might get hurt because of this profession. My family now knows there are some safety nets put in place, but they’re still worried. Wherever I work, my family will come. I havea history, I’m still fighting for justice. I’m a survivor of something really serious and I made it through thanks to the people here. We have Atira Law, down on Cordova, where they help women who have survived abuse or police brutality find advocacy and legal counsel. A lot of people in Chinatown don’t know about programs like this, because there are a lot of other resources. There’s the Downtown Eastside Women’s Centre, which some elderly Chinese folks know about. I hope we can let more people in the community know that there is support out there.

**CT:** Thank you for being so vulnerable. This is a great neighborhood but I don’t think the public hears about a lot of the difficulties people who work and live experience. You briefly mentioned the police, how have you seen policing in the neighborhood or your role in doing community policing?

**S:** A lot of the stores I work with say there’s no use in calling the police. The police take too long to respond, and their problems get handed off to someone else. I don’t think the police are doing enough to keep people safe. Safety should be the priority, and I don’t see that happening.I understand that the police have a lot to deal with because there are bigger crimes, and they can’t be around at all times. I get that. But when people are in trouble and need your help, you can’t make them wait for hours.

**CT:** We’ve heard similar sentiments where elders are hesitant to call the police because there are cultural and language barriers.

**S:** I don’t speak the Chinese language; I wish I did so I could help more, but I try my best to make them feel better.

**CT:** Chinatown is definitely not just a space for Chinese people though, and I think it is important to acknowledge its historical context.

**S:** The people in Chinatown have made us feel included but they’re worried and so they’re hesitant towards certain people. But to make change we need a lot of people, not just 5 or 6, you need a whole community working with the Downtown Eastside.

**CT:** It’s been very heartening to hear that some of the elders we’ve talked to are really open and aware of current issues like Black Lives Matter and Indigenous struggles. It feels like incrementally people are becoming more receptive to having conversations with people from outside their community. Are there ways you think we can bridge conversations between different groups?

**S:** That’s a hard question. It’s the fact that there are people who aren’t receptive to having these kinds of talks and they’re the ones who are causing trouble. A lot of Chinese people are family oriented, just like we are in Italian families. We don’t like to talk about our private lives and are fine with keeping to ourselves. A lot of them just want to run their stores, but now they can’t. It’s hard.

**CT:** Thinking about language barriers, how have you engaged or have had troubles engaging with the Chinatown community?

**S:** It’s hard but we are slowly learning ways to communicate. They have to show me things. Like last week a lady came and had to pull me by the hand to show me needles on the ground. Then they give me the thumbs up when I can solve their problem. It would be great if we had more people who can speak English and Chinese to help with the language barrier. Then we can also communicate about situations in Chinatown. Right now people are so afraid they are just locking their doors.

**CT:** I think we need people who have the training and understand the specific needs of Chinatown and the Downtown Eastside, because right now there are a lot of instanceswhere people have not been equipped to deal with these tough situations. A lot of times they don’t understand the traumas that these communities have and are experiencing.

**S:** With my peer job, I take clients to St. Paul’s Hospital for appointments. My clients are treated differently from “regular” patients because staff can guess their economic and social statuses from their health cards, and they make assumptions about who deserves medical care. These are the things that need to change, but the change is happening too slowly. I wish I could change the system. I’m trying to, but I can’t do it by myself.

**CT:** It sounds like you have gone through a lot and 2020, I’m sure, has made things more difficult. Are there ways that you are taking care of yourself and your mental wellbeing?

**S:** In the beginning I was quite traumatized. I was having more medical issues and was off work for about 3 months. I wasn’t used to being home so much. I’m used to having my days scheduled and structured. I couldn’t handle the stress of COVID-19 in the beginning, so Itook some time off work. Now that I’m back, I see that people are afraid and struggling, but it wasn’t always like that. We really need the government’s help. I know that it’s hard to pay CERB back, I get that, but there needs to be some kind of funding for the people down here so that they don’t have to worry about surviving. Chinatown has been here for many years, and these people deserve to thrive like they did back in the 70s.

**CT:** Are there any activities you’ve been doing to help with your mental health or things that keep you going?

**S:** I do a lot of baking. I’m quite the baker. I like shopping but make sure to wear my mask. These days I stay home a lot. About 2 months ago I started to feel a bit more free with work. Otherwise I’d be home and going crazy.

**CT:** Have you learned anything new about yourself during the pandemic?

**S:** Mentally I’m getting stronger. I’m dealing with things that I might not have dealt with before. I wouldn’t have thought about it last year because I didn’t have the time to think about what I needed as a person. When I took my 3 months of leave I thought about my mental health. I began seeing a therapist through Atira.

## I started getting closer to my family, and am supporting them through their hard times. I’m focused on myself, my family, and making it through my past addictions. I probably wouldn’t have looked at these things if COVID didn’t happen, because I was using my work to avoid everything.

When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, I had no choice but to deal with what I was thinking. I’m not quite where I want to be yet, but with the help of Eastside Works, I know that I’m going to get there.

**CT:** What would you like the reader to take away from reading our conversation with you?

**S:** I think we really need universal basic income to be much more than the $1000 - $1200 people are receiving now, so that people can pay their rent and afford a quality of life. When people were receiving CERB, everyone was pleasant and there was less crime. Right outside my office here, I saw the Downtown Eastside community having a BBQ. And this is something they couldn’t otherwise afford, a few hamburgers and hotdogs. It takes a bit of money for people to be happy, and these people have lived such lows in their lives and have experienced trauma. These people are not nobodies. They need a basic income to live normal lives, get clothing, go to job interviews. They could get the counselling they need. Just feel good about themselves. People can’t even get medical care because they can’t afford it. A welfare cheque isn’t enough. Some Single Room Occupancies are $550- 600, and if your cheque is only $800-900, of course there is going to be crime. People are desperate. The government needs to understand this. I worry that I won’t be around by the time we get to a point where we are all together but I pray for good things.
