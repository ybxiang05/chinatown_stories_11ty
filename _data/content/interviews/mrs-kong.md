title: 邝太
subtitle: Mrs. Kong
blurb: "Mrs. Kong has been a part of the Chinatown neighbourhood for almost a quarter of a century. As a member of the Chinatown Concern Group, Mrs. Kong has been adamant about speaking out against the gentrification of Chinatown. In 2017, her fiery speech at City Hall in opposition to the 105 Keefer project earned her the hearts of Chinatown youths and community organizers alike. Mrs. Kong tells Chinatown Today about the immediate needs of the Chinese senior communities in Chinatown, why Chinese folks should support Indigenous peoples in so-called Canada, and what she loves about hanging out with diasporic Chinese youth. If you want to read about some wholesome intergenerational bonding, this is an interview you don’t want to miss. Additionally, if you speak Cantonese or Mandarin and want to spend some quality time making dumplings, playing mahjong, and singing karaoke with cool Chinese seniors like Mrs. Kong, get in touch with the Yarrow Intergenerational Society for Justice."

CT: 您在唐人街住多久了？
CT: How long have you lived in Chinatown?
K: 二十幾多年了。我 1994 年來的，到加拿大兩三年就來唐人街住了。我是廣東湛
江人。
K: More than twenty years I came to Canada in 1994, and moved to Chinatown
two or three years after. I’m from Zhanjiang in Guangdong.
CT: 您跟家人来的吗？
CT: Did you come here with family?
K: 我通过女兒申請來。我和老公來了十幾天她就回香港了。我們兩公婆在這裏做
洗碗工，做家庭清潔。那時候可以做，什麼工作都做過。在大陸的時候做過很多生
意。
K: My daughter applied for me to come. My daughter went back to Hong Kong
about a week after my husband and I arrived. The two of us made a living
working as dishwashers and house cleaners. I was able to work then, and we
worked lots of different jobs. We ran different businesses in China before
coming here.
CT: 您為什麼選擇來加拿大？
CT: Why did you choose to come to Canada?
K: 我喜歡加拿大，因為我女兒在这里。这里民主。大陸政策運動多，不知道會怎
麼样。我有五個子女。我常擔心他們，擔心學校造反，作為父母害怕。在这里，我
夠膽上市政廳提意見了，所有地方都重視老人有沒有來，在大陸才不會。而且我喜
歡這裡氣候。
K: I love Canada because my daughter was here. It’s democratic here. There
was a lot of political shift in China, you never know what’s going to happen. I
have five children, and I was always worried about them, worried about their
education. As parents, we were scared. Here, I have been able to make my
opinions heard at city hall, and at the meetings they care about seniors. That
wouldn’t happen in China. I also like the climate here.
CT: 您在唐人街最早或最喜歡的記憶是什麼？
CT: What is your earliest or fondest memory of Chinatown?
K: 最喜歡就以前的旺盛，很熱鬧，有很多間買菜的，那時候有華埠超級市場。所以
按我看法，政府沒有理由不理唐人街，因為是唐人的中心，他不會收的，唐人街應
該會發展的，只是因為現在疫症關係無法搞，唐人街收檔就沒成唐人街了。
K: I liked the vibrancy from before, the atmosphere was hot and noisy.
Chinatown was flourishing, there were a lot of places to get groceries; at
the time Chinatown Supermarket was still here. From my point of view, the
government has no reason to neglect Chinatown. Chinatown acts as a gathering
place for Chinese people. It can’t be lost. Chinatown should continue to be
developed, but it’s so hard with the COVID-19 pandemic. Chinatown won’t be
Chinatown anymore if things keep closing.
