title: Goldstone Stories
order: 10
blurb: "In March 2020, Goldstone Restaurant closed its doors and was put up for sale due to the pandemic. With a long list of offerings that span both sides of a legal-sized menu in multiple columns of fine print, Goldstone had been a refuge for nostalgia, community organizing, and affordable, delicious food. Every good story needs a good setting, and in losing Goldstone, we have lost another setting in which Chinatown stories are made. To remember Goldstone, we asked members of the community to share their own stories and memories made here, as well as their favourite items from the menu. To nobodyâ€™s surprise, the famous Goldstone egg tarts were a crowd favourite (it was our favourite, too)."
