Porcelain
was desired for its resiliency
& the ability to paint attractive images
upon its surface

“White gold”
it was called
in eighteenth-century Europe

“Porcelain”
my flesh is called
in this-century North America

my mother was once presented
with the following unsolicited theory:
“white women are strong on the outside but weak on the inside
Asian women are weak on the outside but strong on the inside”

this bullshit (in a china shop)
we sit through and endure

Why
does it have to be about marking
which parts of us
are prone to breaking?

And
what does it have to do
with surface—
considering china
is made from the kilned
ground-up
bones
of dead animals
